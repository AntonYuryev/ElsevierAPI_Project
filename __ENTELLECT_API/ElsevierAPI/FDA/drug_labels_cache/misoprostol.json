    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three times a day two times a day For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day 150 400 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 four times a day three times a day two times a day For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day 150 400 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium/misoprostol dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium/misoprostol should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. GI disorder Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium/misoprostol for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility : Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients : Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment : Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects or [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium/misoprostol or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium/misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney . Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7) ] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal- stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or 75) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium/Misoprostol or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC( 0\u20134h ) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 and diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or 75) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium/Misoprostol or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC( 0\u20134h ) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 and diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion.

CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21 month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ). Table Misoprostol 200 mcg Dosage Regimen Placebo two times a day three times a day four times a day Gastric ulcer 11% 6% Misoprostol significantly different from placebo (p<0.05) 3% 3% Duodenal ulcer 6% 2% 3% 1% N=1623; 12 weeks Results of a study in 572 patients with osteoarthritis demonstrate that patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol have a lower incidence of endoscopically defined gastric ulcers compared to patients receiving diclofenac sodium (see Table 4 ).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Advise females that diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women. Use of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol during pregnancy can result in maternal and fetal harm, including uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Use of diclofenac may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Advise patients not to give diclofenac sodium/misoprostol to others. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . Infertility Advise females of reproductive potential that diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for and the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hepatotoxicity Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and seek immediate medical therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Heart Failure and Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Anaphylactic Reactions Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking diclofenac sodium/misoprostol immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , (5.11) ]. Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in \"over the counter\" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia. Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol until they talk to their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Medication Guide for DICLOFENAC SODIUM/MISOPROSTOL (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets) for oral use What is the most important information I should know about diclofenac sodium/misoprostol? Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol contains diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)) and misoprostol, and can cause uterus to tear (uterine rupture), abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances, if you have given birth to 5 or more children, and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a cesarean delivery. Do not take diclofenac sodium/misoprostol if you are pregnant . Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Females who are able to become pregnant should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. What is the most important information I should know about medicines containing Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase: with increasing doses of NSAIDs with longer use of NSAIDs Do not take NSAID containing medicines right before or after a heart surgery called a \"coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).\" Avoid taking NSAID containing medicines after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), stomach and intestines: anytime during use without warning symptoms that may cause death The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with: past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with use of NSAIDs taking medicines called \"corticosteroids\", \"antiplatelet drugs\", \"anticoagulants\", \"SSRIs\", or \"SNRIs\" increasing doses of NSAIDs longer use of NSAIDs smoking drinking alcohol older age poor health advanced liver disease bleeding problems NSAID containing medicines should only be used: exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible for your treatment for the shortest time needed What is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol? Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol contains 2 medicines: Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). See \" Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD Cmax(pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) Tmax(min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD Cmax(pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) Tmax(min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose."

      "Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.

      "Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion.",
      "Uterine effects Misoprostol Tablets has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS .)",
      "Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol Tablets does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of Misoprostol Tablets.",
      "Clinical Studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70 to 75% on placebo to 10 to 30% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",
      "Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of Misoprostol Tablets, 100 mcg of Misoprostol Tablets, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650 to 1300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of Misoprostol Tablets on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol Tablets did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of Misoprostol Tablets was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol Tablets is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects Misoprostol Tablets may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol Tablets may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol Tablets may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of Misoprostol Tablets for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman.. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking Misoprostol Tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol Tablets is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take Misoprostol Tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS.) Misoprostol Tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol Tablets has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during Misoprostol Tablets therapy, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol Tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take Misoprostol Tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take Misoprostol Tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take Misoprostol Tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give Misoprostol Tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant.

      "Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of Misoprostol Tablets for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of Misoprostol Tablets (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if Misoprostol Tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of Misoprostol Tablets with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received Misoprostol Tablets during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to Misoprostol Tablets administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of Misoprostol Tablets in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for Misoprostol Tablets and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between Misoprostol Tablets and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In these trials there were no significant differences between misoprostol and placebo in relief of day or night abdominal pain. No effect of misoprostol in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen. In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol should not be taken by anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased.

      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Distributed by: ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

THE RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE INCREASES WITH ADVANCING GESTATIONAL AGES AND WITH PRIOR UTERINE SURGERY, INCLUDING CESAREAN DELIVERY (see also PRECAUTIONS and LABOR AND DELIVERY ). MISOPROSTOL SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BY PREGNANT WOMEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ULCERS INDUCED BY NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS ). PATIENTS MUST BE ADVISED OF THE ABORTIFACIENT PROPERTY AND WARNED NOT TO GIVE THE DRUG TO OTHERS. Misoprostol should not be used for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers in women of childbearing potential unless the patient is at high risk of complications from gastric ulcers associated with use of the NSAID, or is at high risk of developing gastric ulceration. In such patients, misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient \u2022 has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. \u2022 is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. \u2022 has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. \u2022 will begin misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 minutes to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0 to 4) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* * Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol of tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Misoprostol (MYE-soe-PROST-ol) Tablets Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol tablets are being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID- induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol tablets may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 minutes to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.

After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion.",

Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 mcg and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 mcg to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",
      "Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks.

      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol of tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Misoprostol (MYE-soe-PROST-ol) Tablets Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol tablets are being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID- induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol tablets may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "Information for Patients Women of childbearing potential using Misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when Misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking Misoprostol . See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with Misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The Misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking Misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep Misoprostol out of the reach of children.

    "labor_and_delivery": [
      "Labor and Delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 minutes to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0 to 4) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* * Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "Clinical Studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 mcg and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 mcg to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",
      "Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650 mg to 1300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician\u2019s clinical assessment, patient\u2019s assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient\u2019s assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol of tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Misoprostol (MYE-soe-PROST-ol) Tablets Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol tablets are being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID- induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol tablets may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, fixed combination products, are administered as Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * Fo r patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers . 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day 200 800 three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * F or patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day, and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Clinical Considerations ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. C linical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Ta ble 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Ta ble 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ).

      "DESCRIPTION Misoprostol oral tablets contain either 100 mcg or 200 mcg of misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E 1 analog. Misoprostol contains approximately equal amounts of the two diastereomers presented below with their enantiomers indicated by (\u00b1): Misoprostol is a water-soluble, viscous liquid. Inactive ingredients of tablets are hydrogenated vegetable oil, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

No effect of misoprostol in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen. In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection.

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In these trials there were no significant differences between misoprostol and placebo in relief of day or night abdominal pain. No effect of misoprostol in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen. In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies. ) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated. (See Clinical Pharmacology. )"

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Revised February 2023 Marketed By: GenBioPro, Inc. P.O.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy (see boxed WARNINGS ). Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol should not be taken by anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN: Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology (see boxed WARNINGS ). Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult oral dose of misoprostol for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is 200 mcg four times daily with food. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used (see Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies ). Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated (see Clinical Pharmacology )."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant (see boxed WARNINGS ). Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. LAB-0646-3.0 Revised February 2025 Logo"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the dosage is given below. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). Note: See Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. section below. For osteoarthritis, the dosage for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. This fixed combination product, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dose of both ingredients. Doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day two times a day 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day 150 400 For rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. This fixed combination product, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dose of both ingredients. Doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day 150 400 \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals ( 2 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: One tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) two or three times daily; or one tablet (containing 75 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) two times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended ( 2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: One tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) two to four times daily; or one tablet (containing 75 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) two times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended ( 2 ) Special Dosing Considerations: Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be changed to the appropriate dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, or use of the individual components to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. The total dose of misoprostol should not exceed 800 mcg/day, and no more than 200 mcg of misoprostol should be administered at any one time. Doses of diclofenac sodium higher than 150 mg/day in osteoarthritis or higher than 200 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis are not recommended. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day. For additional information, it may be helpful to refer to the prescribing information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure ( 5.4 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity) ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Fetal Toxicity : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus ( 4 , 5.11 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients : \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Avoid use in patients at high risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.11 Fetal Toxicity Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . Misoprostol Misoprostol during pregnancy can result in maternal and fetal harm. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.6) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Elderly Overall, there were no significant differences in the safety profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in over 500 patients 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: \u2022 Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. \u2022 Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: \u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \u2022 The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Infertility : NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in women who have difficulties conceiving ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause abortion, premature birth, birth defects or uterine rupture. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eight week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, are known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational ages and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 , 5.14) ] . Of the more than 2,100 subjects in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 25% were 65 and over, while 6% were 75 and over. In studies with diclofenac, 31% of subjects were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Based on studies in the elderly, no adjustment of the dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is necessary in the elderly for pharmacokinetic reasons [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 , 5.14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , although many elderly may need to receive a reduced dose because of low body weight or disorders associated with aging."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause abortion, premature birth, birth defects or uterine rupture. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eight week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, are known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational ages and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.6) ] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets Symptoms of overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive therapy. In case of acute overdosage, gastric lavage is recommended. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population A 4-week study, comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg two times a day) in younger adults (26\u201346 years, N=10) versus elderly subjects (66\u201381 years, N=10), did not show differences between age groups. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid was increased. In a multiple-dose crossover study of 24 elderly subjects aged 65 years or older, the misoprostol contained in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (two times a day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u2219hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u2219hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population A 4-week study, comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg two times a day) in younger adults (26\u201346 years, N=10) versus elderly subjects (66\u201381 years, N=10), did not show differences between age groups. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid was increased. In a multiple-dose crossover study of 24 elderly subjects aged 65 years or older, the misoprostol contained in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (two times a day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and postimplantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper gastrointestinal safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ). Table 3 Misoprostol 200 mcg Dosage Regimen Placebo two times a day three times a day four times a day N=1623; 12 weeks Gastric ulcer 11% 6% Misoprostol significantly different from placebo (p<0.05) 3% 3% Duodenal ulcer 6% 2% 3% 1% Results of a study in 572 patients with osteoarthritis demonstrate that patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have a lower incidence of endoscopically defined gastric ulcers compared to patients receiving diclofenac sodium (see Table 4 ).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Important Dosage Information \u2022 Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. \u2022 After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, are administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (50 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (75 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)]. For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7)]. For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (2) OA: 100 to 150 mg diclofenac/400 to 600 mcg misoprostol per day, divided for administration two or three times a day. Dose of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended (2) RA: 100 to 200 mg diclofenac/400 to 800 mcg misoprostol per day, divided for administration two, three or four times a day. Dose of diclofenac higher than 225 mg/day is not recommended (2) 1 2 3"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. (4, 5.1, 8.1) Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop ( 5.3 ) Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure ( 5.4 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure ( 5.5 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function ( 5.6 ) Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs ( 5.7 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity) ( 5.8 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. (5.11) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia ( 5.11 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated hat patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with nonuse of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemichypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because crossreactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirinsensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hemotologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.7)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 2% from clinical trials) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is derived from Phase III multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse events for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Diclofenac Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper gastrointestinal safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in OA and RA patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended ( 7 ) ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers : Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure ( 7 ) ACE Inhibitors and ARBs : Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function ( 7 ) Diuretics : NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects ( 7 ) Digoxin : Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Infertility : NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in women who have difficulties conceiving ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, misoprostol and diclofenac sodium. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus [see Data ] . There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations ] . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure [see Data ] . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eight week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in a fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, are known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. However, use of NSAIDS (including diclofenac) during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\\ contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: \u2022 has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy \u2022 is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. \u2022 has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. \u2022 will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.7)]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7)]. Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayedrelease tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac/misoprostol is a combination product containing diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin E 1 analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E 1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Absorption Diclofenac: Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol , and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to less than 1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Metabolism Diclofenac: Diclofenac metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol: It undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5 to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20 to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol: After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population A 4-week study, comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg two times a day) in younger adults (26 to 46 years, N=10) versus elderly subjects (66 to 81 years, N=10), did not show differences between age groups. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid was increased. In a multiple-dose crossover study of 24 elderly subjects aged 65 years or older, the misoprostol contained in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (two times a day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac. Age: Pediatric Population Diclofenac and misoprostol have not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole: When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs: In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam: Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs: Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol. 2"

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m2/day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m2/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m2/day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m2/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m2/day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m2/day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m2/day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m2/day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m2/day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m2/day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m2/day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m2/day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In these trials there were no significant differences between misoprostol and placebo in relief of day or night abdominal pain. No effect of misoprostol in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen. In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol should not be taken by anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Distributed by: ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC (0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS . ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis"

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS . ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion.

Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION 8473501/0323F Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics: Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.

After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration- independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics: Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion: Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects: Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS . ) Other pharmacologic effects: Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies: In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70 to 75% on placebo to 10 to 30% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650 to 1300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician\u2019s clinical assessment, patient\u2019s assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient\u2019s assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

Misoprostol tablets has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol tablets should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol tablets has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months\u2019 duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients: Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient\u2019s specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN: Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology: A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects: See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery: Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. Nursing mothers: Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult oral dose of misoprostol for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is 200 mcg four times daily with food. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies . ) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol tablet is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol tablets may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol tablets therapy, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Rx Only Manufactured by: Micro Labs Limited Goa- 403 722, INDIA. Manufactured for: Micro Labs USA, Inc.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, fixed combination products, are administered as Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * Fo r patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers . 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day 250 800 three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * F or patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day, and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets do not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Clinical Considerations ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. C linical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

C linical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets Symptoms of overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive therapy. In case of acute overdosage, gastric lavage is recommended. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Ta ble 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Ta ble 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ).

For a list of factors that may increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers and their complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination of diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and misoprostol, a prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog, indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients at high risk of developing NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers and their complications. ( 1 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, fixed combination products, are administered as Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers . 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day 200 800 three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day, and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Clinical Considerations ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Clinical Considerations ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ). Table3 Misoprostol 200 mcg Dosage Regimen Placebo two times a day three times a day four times a day Gastric ulcer 11% 6% * 3% * 3% * Duodenal ulcer 6% 2% * 3% * 1% * N=1623; 12 weeks *Misoprostol significantly different from placebo (p<0.05) Results of a study in 572 patients with osteoarthritis demonstrate that patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have a lower incidence of endoscopically defined gastric ulcers compared to patients receiving diclofenac sodium (see Table 4 ).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day two times a day* 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day* 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.7 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings, Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/ 200 mcg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclo fenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclo fenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 4h) (pg \u25cf hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 441 (137) 478 (201) 0.30 (0.13) 0.30 (0.10) 266 (95) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 304 (110) 290 (130) 0.26 (0.09) 0.35 (0.12) 117 (49) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 12h) (ng\u25cfhr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 1207 (364) 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 2025 (2005) 2367 (1318) 2.0 (1.4) 1.9 (0.7) 2773 (1347) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclo fenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 4h) (pg \u25cf hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 441 (137) 478 (201) 0.30 (0.13) 0.30 (0.10) 266 (95) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 304 (110) 290 (130) 0.26 (0.09) 0.35 (0.12) 117 (49) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 12h) (ng\u25cfhr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 1207 (364) 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 2025 (2005) 2367 (1318) 2.0 (1.4) 1.9 (0.7) 2773 (1347) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre-and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers.

THE RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE INCREASES WITH ADVANCING GESTATIONAL AGES AND WITH PRIOR UTERINE SURGERY, INCLUDING CESAREAN DELIVERY (See also PRECAUTIONS and LABOR AND DELIVERY ). MISOPROSTOL SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BY PREGNANT WOMEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ULCERS INDUCED BY NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). PATIENTS MUST BE ADVISED OF THE ABORTIFACIENT PROPERTY AND WARNED NOT TO GIVE THE DRUG TO OTHERS. Misoprostol should not be used for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers in women of childbearing potential unless the patient is at high risk of complications from gastric ulcers associated with use of the NSAID, or is at high risk of developing gastric ulceration. In such patients, misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient \u2022 has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. \u2022 is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. \u2022 has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. \u2022 will begin misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.

Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult oral dose of misoprostol for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is 200 mcg four times daily with food. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies. ) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated. (See Clinical Pharmacology. )"

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD Cmax (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) Tmax (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion.",
      "Uterine effects Misoprostol Tablets has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS .)",

Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of Misoprostol Tablets.",
      "clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70 to 75% on placebo to 10 to 30% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",
      "Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of Misoprostol Tablets, 100 mcg of Misoprostol Tablets, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

Misoprostol Tablets did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of Misoprostol Tablets was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. PregnancyPregnancy Category X Teratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol Tablets is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol Tablets may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol Tablets may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol Tablets may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated. (See Clinical Pharmacology .)",
      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking Misoprostol Tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol Tablets is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take Misoprostol Tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol Tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol Tablets has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during Misoprostol Tablets therapy, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol Tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take Misoprostol Tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take Misoprostol Tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take Misoprostol Tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give Misoprostol Tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of Misoprostol Tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of Misoprostol Tablets (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if Misoprostol Tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of Misoprostol Tablets with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received Misoprostol Tablets during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to Misoprostol Tablets administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of Misoprostol Tablets in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for Misoprostol Tablets and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between Misoprostol Tablets and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA).

Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information \u2022 Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . \u2022 After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day two times a day* 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day* 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.7 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: \u2022 Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. \u2022 Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: \u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \u2022 The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/ 200 mcg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: \u2022 has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. \u2022 is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. \u2022 has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. \u2022 will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy.

Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses ofDiclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tabletsor Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 4h) (pg \u25cf hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 441 (137) 478 (201) 0.30 (0.13) 0.30 (0.10) 266 (95) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 304 (110) 290 (130) 0.26 (0.09) 0.35 (0.12) 117 (49) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 12h) (ng\u25cfhr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 1207 (364) 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 2025 (2005) 2367 (1318) 2.0 (1.4) 1.9 (0.7) 2773 (1347) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre-and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3). Table 3 Misoprostol 200 mcg Dosage Regimen Placebo two times a day three times a day four times a day Gastric ulcer 11% 6%* 3%* 3%* Duodenal ulcer 6% 2%* 3%* 1%* N=1623; 12 weeks *Misoprostol significantly different from placebo (p<0.05) Results of a study in 572 patients with osteoarthritis demonstrate that patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have a lower incidence of endoscopically defined gastric ulcers compared to patients receiving diclofenac sodium (see Table 4).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC (0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS . ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis"

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus."

    "labor_and_delivery": [
      "Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS . ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies . ) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION 8473501/0323F Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 0.2 mg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 0.2 mg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, are administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (50 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (75 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three times a day two times a day* 150 600 100 400 Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg four time a day three times a day two times a day* 200 800 150 600 100 400 Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ].

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flulike\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed- release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.7 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )] Anaphylactic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] Serious Skin Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10 )] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Other adverse experiences reported occasionally with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac or other NSAIDs, or misoprostol are: Body as a whole: asthenia, fatigue, malaise.

      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Other adverse experiences reported occasionally with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac or other NSAIDs, or misoprostol are: Body as a whole: asthenia, fatigue, malaise. Central and peripheral nervous system: dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, paresthesia, vertigo. Digestive: anorexia, appetite changes, constipation, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophageal ulceration, oesophagitis, eructation, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux, GI neoplasm benign, peptic ulcer, tenesmus, vomiting. Female reproductive disorders: breast pain, dysmenorrhea, menstrual disorder, menorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage. Hemic and lymphatic system: epistaxis, leukopenia, melena, purpura, decreased hematocrit. Metabolic and nutritional: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, dehydration, hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal system: arthralgia, myalgia. Psychiatric: anxiety, concentration impaired, depression, irritability. Respiratory system: asthma, coughing, hyperventilation. Skin and appendages: alopecia, eczema, pemphigoid reaction, photosensitivity, sweating increased, pruritus. Special senses: taste perversion, tinnitus. Renal and urinary disorders: dysuria, nocturia, polyuria, proteinuria, urinary tract infection. Vision: diplopia.",
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper gastrointestinal safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed- release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 mL/min to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas coadministration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP 2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed- release tablets is administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility : Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients : Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment : Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and Medication Guide 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational ages and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m2/day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m2/day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets ; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) ] and [ Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 )]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, andother reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational ages and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m2/day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m2/day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 )]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, andother reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage 5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acyl glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed- Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed- Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed- Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed- Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac: Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acyl glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21 month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 mg/m 2 /day to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

In a 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 mg/m 2 /day to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD Cmax(pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) Tmax(min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70 to 75% on placebo to 10 to 30% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",

Misoprostol Tablets did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of Misoprostol Tablets was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol Tablets is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects Misoprostol Tablets may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol Tablets may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol Tablets may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of Misoprostol Tablets for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman.. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking Misoprostol Tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol Tablets is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take Misoprostol Tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol Tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol Tablets has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during Misoprostol Tablets therapy, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol Tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take Misoprostol Tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take Misoprostol Tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take Misoprostol Tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give Misoprostol Tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of Misoprostol Tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Rx only December 2019 Manufactured by: Novel Laboratories, Inc. 400 Campus Drive Somerset, NJ 08873 PI1600000102"

Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol.

The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of Misoprostol Tablets (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if Misoprostol Tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of Misoprostol Tablets with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received Misoprostol Tablets during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to Misoprostol Tablets administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of Misoprostol Tablets in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for Misoprostol Tablets and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between Misoprostol Tablets and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information \u2022 Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. \u2022 After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. \u2022 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three times a day two times a day For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day 150 400 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 four times a day three times a day two times a day For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day 150 400 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium/misoprostol dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium/misoprostol should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 )To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC at 1-877-446-3679 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. GI disorder Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: \u2022 Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. \u2022 Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: \u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \u2022 The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \u2022 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium/misoprostol for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility : Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients : Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment : Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data ) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium/misoprostol or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient: \u2022 has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. \u2022 is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. \u2022 has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. \u2022 will begin diclofenac sodium/misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney . Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7) ] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal- stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or 75) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium/Misoprostol or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC( 0\u20134h ) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 and diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 and diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21 month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD Cmax (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u00b7hr/ml) Tmax (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108* 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176* 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79* *Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70 to 75% on placebo to 10 to 30% on misoprostol. Doses of 25 to 200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.",

Misoprostol Tablets did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol Tablets for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol Tablets in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol Tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of an effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of Misoprostol Tablets on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of Misoprostol Tablets was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. PregnancyPregnancy Category X Teratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol Tablets is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol Tablets may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol Tablets may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by Misoprostol Tablets may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. Nursing Mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Misoprostol Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.",

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking Misoprostol Tablets and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol Tablets is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take Misoprostol Tablets to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol Tablets can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol Tablets has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during Misoprostol Tablets therapy, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking Misoprostol Tablets and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol Tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take Misoprostol Tablets with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take Misoprostol Tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take Misoprostol Tablets only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give Misoprostol Tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of Misoprostol Tablets. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. Rx only January 2016 Manufactured by: Novel Laboratories, Inc. Somerset, NJ 08873 PI1600003502"

    "labor_and_delivery": [
      "Labor and Delivery Misoprostol Tablets can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of Misoprostol Tablets, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Misoprostol Tablets is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of Misoprostol Tablets outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol Tablets should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of Misoprostol Tablets on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Misoprostol Tablets is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on Misoprostol Tablet's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets: Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14 to 40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13 to 20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of Misoprostol Tablets (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if Misoprostol Tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of Misoprostol Tablets with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological: Women who received Misoprostol Tablets during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to Misoprostol Tablets administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Elderly: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of Misoprostol Tablets in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving Misoprostol Tablets and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for Misoprostol Tablets and placebo. Causal relationship unknown: The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between Misoprostol Tablets and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.

After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS. Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol\u2019s effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS. ) Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies. ) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime.

      "SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy (see boxed WARNINGS ). Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol should not be taken by anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN: Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol: Gastrointestinal In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology (see boxed WARNINGS ). Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA). Gastrointestinal: GI bleeding, GI inflammation/infection, rectal disorder, abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase increase. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reaction Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection. Nervous system/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression, drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase, neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia, purpura, ESR increased."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult oral dose of misoprostol for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is 200 mcg four times daily with food. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used (see Clinical Pharmacology: Clinical studies ). Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. Renal impairment Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg dose is not tolerated (see Clinical Pharmacology )."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant (see boxed WARNINGS ). Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. Keep out of reach of children. LAB-0646-3.0 Revised February 2025 Logo"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day two times a day* 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day* 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.7 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings, Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/ 200 mcg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) .

The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%).

Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg.

Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre-and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Medication Guide for Diclofenac Sodium (dye-KLOE-fen-ak SOE-dee-um) and Misoprostol (MYE-soe-PROST-ol) Delayed-Release Tablets for oral use What is the most important information I should know about diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets? Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)) and misoprostol, and can cause uterus to tear (uterine rupture), abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances, if you have given birth to 5 or more children, and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a cesarean delivery. Do not take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets if you are pregnant. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Females who are able to become pregnant should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. What is the most important information I should know about medicines containing Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase: with increasing doses of NSAIDs with longer use of NSAIDs Do not take NSAID containing medicines right before or after a heart surgery called a \u201ccoronary artery bypass graft (CABG).\" Avoid taking NSAID containing medicines after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), stomach and intestines: anytime during use without warning symptoms that may cause death The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with: past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with use of NSAIDs taking medicines called \u201ccorticosteroids\u201d, \u201cantiplatelet drugs\u201d, \u201canticoagulants\u201d, \u201cSSRIs\u201d, or \u201cSNRIs\u201d increasing doses of NSAIDs older age longer use of NSAIDs poor health smoking advanced liver disease drinking alcohol bleeding problems NSAID containing medicines should only be used: exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible for your treatment for the shortest time needed What are diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets? Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains 2 medicines: 1. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? 2. Misoprostol is a medicine used to protect the lining of the esophagus, stomach and intestines while taking diclofenac. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat: symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in adults at high risk of developing stomach (gastric) and intestinal (duodenal) ulcers while taking NSAIDs.

UTERINE RUPTURE HAS BEEN REPORTED WHEN MISOPROSTOL WAS ADMINISTERED IN PREGNANT WOMEN TO INDUCE LABOR OR TO INDUCE ABORTION. THE RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE INCREASES WITH ADVANCING GESTATIONAL AGES AND WITH PRIOR UTERINE SURGERY, INCLUDING CESAREAN DELIVERY (see also PRECAUTIONS and LABOR AND DELIVERY ). MISOPROSTOL SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BY PREGNANT WOMEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ULCERS INDUCED BY NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). PATIENTS MUST BE ADVISED OF THE ABORTIFACIENT PROPERTY AND WARNED NOT TO GIVE THE DRUG TO OTHERS. Misoprostol should not be used for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers in women of childbearing potential unless the patient is at high risk of complications from gastric ulcers associated with use of the NSAID, or is at high risk of developing gastric ulceration. In such patients, misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose. Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output. Effects on gastric acid secretion Misoprostol, over the range of 50\u2013200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. Uterine effects Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy (see boxed WARNINGS ). Other pharmacologic effects Misoprostol does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of misoprostol. Clinical studies In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70\u201375% on placebo to 10\u201330% on misoprostol. Doses of 25\u2013200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding. Reducing the risk of gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of misoprostol, 100 mcg of misoprostol, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650\u20131300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study evaluated the possible interference of misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. In normal volunteers, misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of misoprostol acid of 12 \u00b1 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20\u201340 minutes. There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200\u2013400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Mean \u00b1 SD C max (pg/ml) AUC(0\u20134) (pg\u2219hr/ml) T max (min) Fasting 811 \u00b1 317 417 \u00b1 135 14 \u00b1 8 With Antacid 689 \u00b1 315 349 \u00b1 108 Comparisons with fasting results statistically significant, p<0.05. 20 \u00b1 14 With High Fat Breakfast 303 \u00b1 176 373 \u00b1 111 64 \u00b1 79 After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T 1/2 , C max , and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 \u00b5g and 600 \u00b5g misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "Pharmacodynamics Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Misoprostol is indicated for reducing the risk of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)\u2013induced gastric ulcers in patients at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, e.g., the elderly and patients with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer. Misoprostol has not been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in controlled studies of 3 months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol should not be taken by anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Caution should be employed when administering misoprostol to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Information for patients Women of childbearing potential using misoprostol to decrease the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers should be told that they must not be pregnant when misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective contraception method while taking misoprostol. See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with misoprostol, the physician should be contacted promptly. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE MISOPROSTOL TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she were to become pregnant. The misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will include a leaflet containing patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet may have been revised. Keep misoprostol out of the reach of children. SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN: Misoprostol may cause birth defects, abortion (sometimes incomplete), premature labor or rupture of the uterus if given to pregnant women. Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes a leaflet containing patient information. See Patient Information at the end of this labeling. Drug interactions See Clinical Pharmacology . Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol may augment the activity of oxytocic agents, especially when given less than 4 hours prior to initiating oxytocin treatment. Concomitant use is not recommended. Animal toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility There was no evidence of an effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there was no effect of misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic potential of misoprostol was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively. Nonteratogenic effects See boxed WARNINGS . Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Labor and delivery Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol. Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate. The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown. The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation. Nursing mothers Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established."

The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14\u201340% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13\u201320% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology (see boxed WARNINGS ). Elderly There were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of age or older compared with younger patients. Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows: Incidence greater than 1% In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving misoprostol and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%), headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%). However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of these events for misoprostol and placebo. Causal relationship unknown The following adverse events were infrequently reported. Causal relationships between misoprostol and these events have not been established but cannot be excluded: Body as a whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, chills, rigors, weight changes. Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. Special senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness, tinnitus, earache. Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope, myocardial infarction (some fatal), thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, and CVA).

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant (see boxed WARNINGS ). Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death. If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food. Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician. Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg three times a day two times a day * 150 100 600 400 diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day * 200 150 100 800 600 400 diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most post-marketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In post-marketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Post-marketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and post-marketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg or diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporin Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment : Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and post-marketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these post-marketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney . Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac and misoprostol. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac and misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation.

It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7) ] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg and diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac: Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acyl glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol: Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol: After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole: When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs: In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam: Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs: Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg and Misoprostol 200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac Sodium 75 mg and Misoprostol 200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg and Misoprostol 200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac Sodium 75 mg and Misoprostol 200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac: Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium 50 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg and diclofenac sodium 75 mg and misoprostol 200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac: Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acyl glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol: Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol: After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole: When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs: In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam: Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs: Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21 month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24 month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 mcg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, fixed combination products, are administered as Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers . 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day 200 800 three times a day 150 600 two times a day * 100 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day * 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day, and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia.

( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.7) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Reversible Infertility: Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) \u2022 Geriatric Patients: Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women ( see Clinical Considerations ). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure ( see Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General pharmacokinetic characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2 ). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1\u20134 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Population No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u00b5g, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with asprin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart . Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3 ).

These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. WARNING: RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE, ABORTION, PREMATURE BIRTH, BIRTH DEFECTS; SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; AND SERIOUS GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered in pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnancy and are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. ( 5.1 , 8.3 ) Increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. ( 5.2 ) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. ( 4 , 5.2 ) Increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal and can occur at any time and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk. ( 5.3 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Osteoarthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 0.2 mg of misoprostol) three times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.2 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended dosage for maximal GI protection is one tablet (containing 50 mg of diclofenac and 0.2 mg of misoprostol) three or four times daily. A dosage of diclofenac higher than 200 mg/day is not recommended. ( 2.3 ) For dosage modifications due to intolerance, see the full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, are administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (50 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (75 mg diclofenac sodium/0.2 mg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three times a day 150 600 two times a day* 100 400 Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg four times a day 200 800 three times a day 150 600 two times a day* 100 400 Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg two times a day* 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs : Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac in women at about 20 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy may cause oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 4 , 5.1 , 8.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.5 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.7 ) Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.8 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.9 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.10 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.11 ) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.7 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Reversible Infertility : Consider withdrawal in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Patients : Avoid use in patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment : Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data ). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data) . Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.7 )] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 ), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4) ] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data ) . Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2 /day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity."

In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.7 )] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7)] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u20134h) (pg\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg 441 (137) 0.30 (0.13) 266 (95) Misoprostol 478 (201) 0.30 (0.10) 295 (143) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg 304 (110) 0.26 (0.09) 177 (49) Misoprostol 290 (130) 0.35 (0.12) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0\u201312h) (ng\u00b7hr/mL) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 50 mg/0.2 mg 1207 (364) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) Diclofenac Sodium 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 1357 (290) Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets 75 mg/0.2 mg 2025 (2005) 2.0 (1.4) 2773 (1347) Diclofenac Sodium 2367 (1318) 1.9 (0.7) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max : Peak concentration; T max : Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac : Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol : Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg. Distribution Diclofenac : The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol : The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac : Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol : Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac : Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol : After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 mcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max , and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin : When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Voriconazole : When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions (7)] . In vitro , diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro , on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs : In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam : Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs : Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2 /day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2 /day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2 /day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 /day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2 /day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2 /day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2 /day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, a fixed combination product, is administered as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol). 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 150 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Osteoarthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day two times a day* 150 100 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 *For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg three or four times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. A daily dosage of diclofenac sodium greater than 200 mg/day is not recommended. Daily doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows: Rheumatoid Arthritis Regimen Diclofenac Sodium (mg/day) Misoprostol (mcg/day) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg four times a day three times a day two times a day* 200 150 100 800 600 400 Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day* 150 400 * For patients who experience intolerance; these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers 2.4 Additional Dosage Recommendations Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers [see Clinical Studies ( 14)] . For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)] , and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients. Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . For additional information, refer to the Prescribing Information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5. Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3)] . Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)] . 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications ( 4)] . Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications ( 4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9)] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4)] . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications ( 4)] . 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3, 5.7)] ."

Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10)] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies ( 14)]. GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings, Contraindications ( 4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5)] .

      "7. Drug Interactions See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac and misoprostol. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac and Misoprostol Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] . Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)] . Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: The concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution. Patients should be adequately hydrated and the clinical need to monitor the renal function should be assessed at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)] . Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] . Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of diclofenac and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. Avoid diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. Antacids Clinical Impact: Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated diarrhea. Intervention: Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. Corticosteroids Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of corticosteroids with diclofenac may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] . CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Impact: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., voriconzaole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Intervention: CYP2C9 inhibitors: When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/ 200 mcg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4)] . CYP2C9 inducers: A dosage adjustment may be warranted when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with CYP2C9 inducers. Administer the separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary."

      "8. Use in Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4)]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] . Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug\u2019s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment ( see Data). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure (see Data). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4)]. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Misoprostol Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of misoprostol for the induction of labor in the third trimester was associated with uterine hyperstimulation with resulting changes in the fetal heart rate (fetal bradycardia) and fetal death (misoprostol is not approved for this use). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women [see Contraindications ( 4)]. Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy (see Data). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (see Data). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture. Data Human Data Misoprostol Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. Diclofenac Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use (including diclofenac) in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m 2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m 2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. At the high dose, there was evidence of embryotoxicity (resorption and decreased fetal body weight) and maternal toxicity (decreased food intake and weight gain). In oral teratology studies with misoprostol in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/m 2/day, 16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2/day, 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In oral teratology studies with diclofenac sodium in pregnant mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area), pregnant rats at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m 2/day, 0.4 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (120 mg/m 2/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No lactation studies have been conducted with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets; however, limited published literature reports that diclofenac and the active metabolite of misoprostol are present in breast milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] . If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Contraception Females Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Contraindications ( 4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period . Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1)]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.3, 5.7)] . In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions ( 7) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)] . Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)] . Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs . Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient\u2019s renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7), Drug Interactions ( 7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10. Overdosage Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving. The toxic dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has not been determined. However, signs of overdosage from the components of the product have been described. Diclofenac Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7)] . Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness, or general hypotonia. If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Misoprostol The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of GI discomfort being reported. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Symptoms of acute overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy. There are no specific antidotes. In case of acute overdosage, emesisis and/or gastric lavage may be considered dependent upon amount ingested and time since ingestion. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven."

      "11. Description Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, USP is a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic properties, and misoprostol, a gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are white to off-white, round, biconvex, and approximately 11 mm in diameter. Each tablet consists of an enteric-coated core containing 50 mg (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg) or 75 mg (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg) of diclofenac sodium (equivalent to 46.39 mg or 69.58 mg of diclofenac, respectively) surrounded by an outer mantle containing 200 mcg misoprostol. Diclofenac sodium is a phenylacetic acid derivative that is a white to off-white, virtually odorless, crystalline powder. Diclofenac sodium is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and in dilute acid. Diclofenac sodium is sparingly soluble in water. Its chemical formula and name are: C 14H 10Cl 2NO 2Na [M.W. = 318.14] 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzeneacetic acid, monosodium salt. Misoprostol is a water-soluble, viscous liquid that contains approximately equal amounts of two diastereomers. Its chemical formula and name are: C 22H 38O 5 [M.W. = 382.54] (\u00b1) methyl 11\u03b1,16-dihydroxy-16-methyl-9-oxoprost-13E-en-1-oate.

      "12. Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are a combination product containing diclofenac sodium, an NSAID with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, and misoprostol, a GI mucosal protective prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) analog. Diclofenac The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. Misoprostol Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both. In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained. Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion. Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Diclofenac and Misoprostol Acid Following Single Oral Doses of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets or Separate Products in Healthy Subjects MISOPROSTOL ACID Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (pg/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 4h) (pg \u25cfhr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 441 (137) 478 (201) 0.30 (0.13) 0.30 (0.10) 266 (95) 295 (143) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Misoprostol 304 (110) 290 (130) 0.26 (0.09) 0.35 (0.12) 117 (49) 176 (58) DICLOFENAC Mean (SD) Treatment (n=36) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) AUC (0 to 12h) (ng\u25cfhr/mL) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 1207 (364) 1298 (441) 2.4 (1.0) 2.4 (1.0) 1380 (272) 1357 (290) Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg Diclofenac Sodium 2025 (2005) 2367 (1318) 2.0 (1.4) 1.9 (0.7) 2773 (1347) 2609 (1185) SD: Standard deviation of the mean; AUC: Area under the curve; C max: Peak concentration; T max: Time to peak concentration Absorption Diclofenac: Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration under fasted condition, and peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism (i.e., oral bioavailability is 50%). Misoprostol: Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, and misoprostol acid (active metabolite) reaches a maximum plasma concentration in approximately 20 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg. Distribution Diclofenac: The volume of distribution of diclofenac is approximately 0.55 L/kg. More than 99% of diclofenac is bound to plasma albumin. Misoprostol: The plasma protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to <1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose. These data may not reflect drug level in mature milk and in a daily dosing regimen for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Elimination Metabolism Diclofenac: Metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP2C9 in the liver. Five metabolites (4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac) have been identified. The major metabolite (4'-hydroxy-diclofenac) has very weak pharmacologic activity. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Misoprostol: Undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Excretion Diclofenac: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h). Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. Misoprostol: After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, approximately 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were observed in geriatric subjects (66 to 81 years; N=10) compared to younger adult subjects (26 to 46 years; N=10) following administration of diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Though the mean AUC value of misoprostol acid for elderly subjects was 41% higher in geriatric healthy subjects (mean age, 69.5\u00b14.6 years, N=24) compared to younger adult healthy subjects (mean age, 25.4\u00b14.2 years, N=24) following single dose of misoprostol 400 \u03bcg, the increase in exposure is not clinically meaningful. In a multiple-dose crossover study of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets administered twice daily to 24 subjects aged 65 years of age and older, misoprostol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5)] . Racial or Ethnic Groups Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min) following intravenous administration of 50 mg diclofenac, AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis (n=8, mean creatinine clearance 6.2\u00b13.3 mL/min/1.73m 2) who received a single dose of 400 mcg misoprostol during a interdialytic period showed an approximate doubling of elimination half-life, C max, and AUC of misoprostol acid compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubin, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values following administration of 100 mg oral solution were comparable to those in healthy subjects. In a study of subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C max showed approximately twice high as the mean values obtained in healthy subjects. Three subjects who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C max values. Drug Interaction Studies Diclofenac Aspirin: When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac was reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . Voriconazole: When a single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was co-administered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2), the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 114% and 78%, respectively, when compared to diclofenac alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7)] . In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding). Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence, in vitro, on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum. Other drugs: In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline or digitoxin did not significantly affect C max and AUC of diclofenac. Misoprostol Diazepam: Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart. Other drugs: Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol."

      "13. Non-Clinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m 2/day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m 2/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m 2/day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, diclofenac sodium administered orally at up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m 2/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2/day, 0.006 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2/day, 0.02 times the MRHD based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combination in 250:1 ratio was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m 2/day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre-and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m 2/day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m 2/day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol."

      "14. Clinical Studies Osteoarthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis Diclofenac sodium, as a single ingredient or in combination with misoprostol, has been shown to be effective in the management of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Upper Gastrointestinal Safety Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).
