(2.1) Cumulative dosage of 3.5 mg/kg administered orally and divided into 2 treatment courses (1.75 mg/kg per treatment course). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles. (2.2) Cladribine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. (2.4) Separate administration from any other oral drug by at least 3 hours. (2.4) 2.1 Assessments Prior to Starting Each Cladribine Treatment Course Cancer Screening Follow standard cancer screening guidelines because of the risk of malignancies [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Pregnancy Exclude pregnancy prior to treatment with cladribine tablets in females of reproductive potential [ see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Lymphocytes must be: within normal limits before initiating the first treatment course at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment course If necessary, delay the second treatment course for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of lymphocytes to at least 800 cells per microliter. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive further treatment with cladribine tablets. Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Exclude HIV infection. Perform tuberculosis screening. Screen for hepatitis B and C. Evaluate for acute infection. Consider a delay in cladribine treatment until any acute infection is fully controlled. Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for VZV is recommended prior to initiation of cladribine tablets. Vaccination of patients who are seropositive to VZV is recommended with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted. Patients may be administered zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted at any time prior to or during the year 1 or year 2 course of cladribine treatment. These patients may also be administered the vaccine if their lymphocyte counts are \u2264 500 cells per microliter. Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Liver Injury Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended cumulative dosage of cladribine tablets is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles: Administration of First Treatment Course First Course/First Cycle: start any time. First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle. Administration of Second Treatment Course Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle. Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily. Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional cladribine treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating cladribine tablets more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied. 2.3 Missed Dose If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses. If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days. 2.4 Administration Cladribine tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. Cladribine tablets can be taken with or without food. Separate administration of cladribine tablets and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day cladribine treatment cycles [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ]. Cladribine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [ see References (15) ]. Cladribine tablets are an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water. The patient\u2019s hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin. 2.5 Laboratory Testing and Monitoring to Assess Safety Cancer Screening Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with cladribine tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Complete Blood Count Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count: before initiating the first treatment course of cladribine tablets before initiating the second treatment course of cladribine tablets 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment course; if the lymphocyte count at month 2 is below 200 cells per microliter, monitor monthly until month 6. See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3, 5.4 ) for instructions based on the patient\u2019s lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections). Hold cladribine tablets therapy if the lymphocyte count is below 200 cells per microliter periodically thereafter and when clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] 2.6 Recommended Concomitant Medication Herpes Prophylaxis Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lymphopenia: Monitor lymphocyte counts before, during and after treatment. (5.3) Infections: Serious, including life-threatening and fatal infections, have occurred. Screen patients for active and latent infections; delay treatment until infection is fully resolved or controlled. Vaccination of patients seronegative to varicella zoster virus (VZV) is recommended prior to treatment. Vaccination of patients seropositive to VZV with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted, is recommended prior to or during treatment. Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter. Monitor for infections. (5.4) Hematologic toxicity: Monitor complete blood count before, during and after treatment. (5.5) Graft-versus-host-disease with blood transfusion: Irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended. (5.6) Liver injury: Clinically significant liver injury has occurred. Obtain tests prior to treatment. Discontinue if clinically significant injury is suspected. (5.7) 5.1 Malignancies Treatment with cladribine tablets may increase the risk of malignancy. In controlled and extension clinical studies worldwide, malignancies occurred more frequently in cladribine-treated patients [10 events in 3,754 patient-years (0.27 events per 100 patient-years)], compared to placebo patients [3 events in 2,275 patient-years (0.13 events per 100 patient-years)]. Malignancy cases in cladribine patients included metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma (2 cases), ovarian cancer, compared to malignancy cases in placebo patients, all of which were curable by surgical resection [basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ (2 cases)]. The incidence of malignancies in United States cladribine clinical study patients was higher than the rest of the world [4 events in 189 patient-years (2.21 events per 100 patient-years) compared to 0 events in United States placebo patients]; however, the United States results were based on a limited amount of patient data. After the completion of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional cladribine treatment during the next 2 years [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. In clinical studies, patients who received additional cladribine treatment within 2 years after the first 2 treatment courses had an increased incidence of malignancy [7 events in 790 patient-years (0.91 events per 100 patient-years) calculated from the start of cladribine treatment in Year 3]. The risk of malignancy with reinitiating cladribine tablets more than 2 years after the completion of 2 treatment courses has not been studied. Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of cladribine tablets on an individual patient basis. Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with cladribine tablets. 5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity Cladribine tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during cladribine tablets dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of cladribine tablets and prevented by the use of effective contraception during cladribine tablets dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with cladribine tablets should discontinue treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . Cladribine tablets are contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. 5.3 Lymphopenia Cladribine tablets cause a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of cladribine-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of cladribine tablets 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks. Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if cladribine tablets are administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%). Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with cladribine tablets. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient\u2019s lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections). 5.4 Infections Serious, including life-threatening or fatal, bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections have been reported in patients receiving cladribine tablets. Cladribine tablets reduces the body's immune defense, and an increased risk of infections has been observed in patients receiving cladribine tablets. Infections occurred in 49% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 44% of placebo patients in clinical studies; serious or severe infections occurred in 2.4% of cladribine-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent serious infections in cladribine-treated patients included herpes zoster and pyelonephritis ( see Herpes Virus Infections ). Fungal infections were observed, including cases of coccidioidomycosis. In the postmarketing setting, serious infections have been reported, including nocardiosis, varicella zoster, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. The majority of patients with these infections who had an available absolute lymphocyte count at the time of the event had concurrent lymphopenia, consistent with the mechanism of action of cladribine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. HIV infection, active tuberculosis, and active hepatitis must be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of cladribine tablets [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Delay initiation of cladribine tablets in patients with an acute infection until the infection is fully resolved or controlled. Initiation of cladribine tablets in patients currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Concomitant use of cladribine tablets with these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. Tuberculosis Three of 1,976 (0.2%) cladribine-treated patients in the clinical program developed tuberculosis. All three cases occurred in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. One case of tuberculosis was fatal, and two cases resolved with treatment. Perform tuberculosis screening prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of cladribine tablets. Latent tuberculosis infections may be activated with use of cladribine tablets. In patients with tuberculosis infection, delay initiation of cladribine tablets until the infection has been adequately treated. Hepatitis One clinical study patient died from fulminant hepatitis B infection. Perform screening for hepatitis B and C prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of cladribine tablets. Latent hepatitis infections may be activated with use of cladribine tablets. Patients who are carriers of hepatitis B or C virus may be at risk of irreversible liver damage caused by virus reactivation. In patients with hepatitis infection, delay initiation of cladribine tablets until the infection has been adequately treated. Herpes Virus Infections In controlled clinical studies, 6% of cladribine-treated patients developed a herpes viral infection compared to 2% of placebo patients. The most frequent types of herpes viral infections were herpes zoster infections (2.0% vs. 0.2%) and oral herpes (2.6% vs. 1.2%). Serious herpes zoster infections occurred in 0.2% of cladribine-treated patients. Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for varicella zoster virus is recommended prior to initiation of cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets. Vaccination with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted is recommended for patients who are seropositive to VZV, either prior to or during cladribine treatment, including when their lymphocyte counts are less than or equal to 500 cells per microliter. The incidence of herpes zoster was higher during the period of absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells per microliter, compared to the time when the patients were not experiencing this degree of lymphopenia. Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter. Patients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells per microliter should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of infections, including herpes infections. If such signs and symptoms occur, initiate treatment as clinically indicated. Consider interruption or delay of cladribine tablets until resolution of the infection. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. No case of PML has been reported in clinical studies of cladribine in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients treated with parenteral cladribine for oncologic indications, cases of PML have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initiating the first treatment course of cladribine tablets. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold cladribine tablets and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccinations Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets, because of a risk of active vaccine infection (see Herpes Virus Infections) . Avoid vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines during and after cladribine treatment while the patient\u2019s white blood cell counts are not within normal limits. 5.5 Hematologic Toxicity In addition to lymphopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] , decreases in other blood cells and hematological parameters have been reported with cladribine in clinical studies. Mild to moderate decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count between 1,000 cells per microliter and < lower limit of normal (LLN)) were observed in 27% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 13% of placebo patients whereas severe decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count below 1,000 cells per microliter) were observed in 3.6% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 2.8% of placebo patients. Decreases in hemoglobin levels, in general mild to moderate (hemoglobin 8 g per dL to < LLN), were observed in 26% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 19% of placebo patients. Decreases in platelet counts were generally mild (cell count 75,000 cells per microliter to < LLN) and were observed in 11% of cladribine- treated patients, compared to 4% of placebo patients. In clinical studies at dosages similar to or higher than the approved cladribine dosage, serious cases of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia (some with documented bone marrow hypoplasia) requiring transfusion and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) for information regarding graft-versus- host disease with blood transfusion ]. Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential prior to, during, and after treatment with cladribine tablets [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) ]. 5.6 Risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Blood Transfusion Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed rarely after transfusion of nonirradiated blood in patients treated with cladribine for non-MS treatment indications. In patients who require blood transfusion, irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended prior to administration to decrease the risk of transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease. Consultation with a hematologist is advised. 5.7 Liver Injury Cladribine tablets can cause liver injury. In clinical studies, 0.3% of cladribine-treated patients had liver injury (serious or causing treatment discontinuation) considered related to treatment, compared to 0 placebo patients. Onset ranged from a few weeks to several months after initiation of treatment with cladribine. Signs and symptoms of liver injury, including elevation of serum aminotransferases to greater than 20-fold the upper limit of normal, were observed. These abnormalities resolved upon treatment discontinuation. Clinically significant and life-threatening liver injury has been reported in patients treated with cladribine tablets in the postmarketing setting. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and patients taking other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for developing liver injury when taking cladribine tablets. Most reported cases of liver injury associated with cladribine tablets occurred approximately 30 days after initiation (i.e., course 1, cycle 1) of treatment. Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 6) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. If a patient develops clinical signs, including unexplained liver enzyme elevations, or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with cladribine tablets, as appropriate. 5.8 Hypersensitivity In clinical studies, 11% of cladribine-treated patients had hypersensitivity reactions, compared to 7% of placebo patients. Hypersensitivity reactions that were serious and/or led to discontinuation of cladribine tablets (e.g., dermatitis, pruritis) occurred in 0.5% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 0.1% of placebo patients. One patient had a serious hypersensitivity reaction with rash, mucous membrane ulceration, throat swelling, vertigo, diplopia, and headache after the first dose of cladribine tablets. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue cladribine therapy. Do not use cladribine tablets in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cladribine [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Cardiac Failure In clinical studies, one cladribine-treated patient experienced life-threatening acute cardiac failure with myocarditis, which improved after approximately one week. Cases of cardiac failure have also been reported with parenteral cladribine used for treatment indications other than multiple sclerosis. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if they experience symptoms of cardiac failure (e.g., shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, swelling)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions and potential risks are discussed, or discussed in greater detail, in other sections of the labeling: Malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Risk of Teratogenicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Lymphopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hematologic Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Blood Transfusion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Cardiac Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 20%) are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the clinical trial program of cladribine in MS, 1,976 patients received cladribine for a total of 9,509 patient years. The mean time on study including follow-up was approximately 4.8 years, and approximately 24% of cladribine-treated patients had approximately 8 years of time on study including follow-up. Of these, 923 patients aged 18 to 66 years received cladribine as monotherapy at a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg per kg. Table 2 shows adverse reactions in Study 1 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] with an incidence of at least 5% for cladribine and higher than placebo. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions reported in Study 1 are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia.

Alopecia Alopecia occurred in 3% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo patients. Myelodysplastic Syndrome Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in patients that had received parenteral cladribine at a higher dosage than that approved for cladribine. These cases occurred several years after treatment. Herpes Meningoencephalitis Fatal herpes meningoencephalitis occurred in one cladribine-treated patient, at a higher dosage and longer duration of therapy than the approved cladribine dosage and in combination with interferon beta-1a treatment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) SJS and TEN are identified risks of parenteral cladribine for the treatment of oncologic indications. Seizures In clinical studies, serious events of seizure occurred in 0.3% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 0 placebo patients. Serious events included generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus. It is unknown whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to cladribine, or to a combination of both. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of cladribine.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3 Drug Interactions with cladribine tablets 7.1 Immunomodulatory, Immunosuppressive, or Myelosuppressive Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or myelosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive effects on the immune system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Prevention or Management Concomitant use with myelosuppressive or other immunosuppressive drugs is not recommended. Acute short-term therapy with corticosteroids can be administered. In patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, consider potential additive effect, the mode of action, and duration of effect of the other drugs prior to initiation of cladribine. 7.2 Interferon-Beta Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with interferon-beta did not change the exposure of cladribine to a clinically significant effect; however, lymphopenia risk may be increased [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Prevention or Management Concomitant use is not recommended. 7.3 Hematotoxic Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with hematotoxic drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive hematological effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Prevention or Management Monitor hematological parameters. 7.4 Antiviral and Antiretroviral Drugs Clinical Impact Compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine) could interfere with the intracellular phosphorylation and activity of cladribine. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use. 7.5 Potent ENT, CNT and BCRP Transporter Inhibitors Clinical Impact Cladribine is a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside (ENT1), and concentrative nucleoside (CNT3) transport proteins. The bioavailability, intracellular distribution, and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3, and BCRP transporter inhibitors. Prevention or Management Avoid co-administration of potent ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, eltrombopag, curcumin, cyclosporine, dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, cilostazol, sulindac, dipyridamole, or reserpine) during the 4 to 5 day cladribine treatment cycles. If this is not possible, consider selection of alternative concomitant drugs with no or minimal ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibiting properties. If this is not possible, dose reduction to the minimum mandatory dose of drugs containing these compounds, separation in the timing of administration, and careful patient monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Potent BCRP and P-gp Transporter Inducers Clinical Impact Possible decrease in cladribine exposure if potent BCRP or P-gp transporter inducers are co-administered. Prevention or Management Consider a possible decrease in cladribine efficacy if potent BCRP (e.g., corticosteroids) or P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's Wort) transporter inducers are co-administered. Immunosuppressive drugs: Consider overlapping effects on immune system, when used sequentially. Concomitant use not recommended. (7.1) Hematotoxic drugs: Monitor patients for additive effects on the hematological profile. (7.3) Antiviral and antiretroviral drugs: Avoid concomitant use. (7.4) BCRP or ENT/CNT inhibitors: May alter bioavailability of cladribine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.5)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women and in females and males of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of cladribine in pregnant women. Cladribine was embryolethal when administered to pregnant mice and produced malformations in mice and rabbits [ see Data ]. The observed developmental effects are consistent with the effects of cladribine on DNA [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and malformations (including exencephaly and cleft palate) and embryofetal death were observed at the highest dose tested. An increase in skeletal variations was observed at all but the lowest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and a high incidence of craniofacial and limb malformations were observed at the highest dose tested, in the absence of maternal toxicity. When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day) to mice throughout pregnancy and lactation, skeletal anomalies and embryolethality were observed at all but the lowest dose tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in breastfeeding women because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Advise women not to breastfeed during dosing with cladribine and for 10 days after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of cladribine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before the initiation of each treatment course of cladribine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential should prevent pregnancy by use of effective contraception during cladribine dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during cladribine tablets therapy should discontinue treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Males As cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on human gametogenesis could be expected. Therefore, male patients of reproductive potential should take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their partner during cladribine dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients (below 18 years of age) have not been established. Use of cladribine is not recommended in pediatric patients because of the risk of malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Caution is recommended when cladribine is used in elderly patients, taking into account the potential greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, concomitant diseases, and other drug therapy. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment The concentration of cladribine is predicted to increase in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to 89 mL per minute). Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 60 mL per minute) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 6) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Particularly close monitoring of hematological parameters is recommended in patients who have been exposed to an overdose of cladribine tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5) ]. There is no known specific antidote to an overdose of cladribine tablets. Treatment consists of careful observation and initiation of appropriate supportive measures. Discontinuation of cladribine tablets may need to be considered. Because of the rapid and extensive intracellular and tissue distribution, hemodialysis is unlikely to eliminate cladribine to a significant extent."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Cladribine tablets contains the nucleoside metabolic inhibitor cladribine, which is a white to off-white crystalline powder with the molecular formula C 10 H 12 ClN 5 O 3 and molecular weight 285.69 g/mol. It differs in structure from the naturally occurring nucleoside, deoxyadenosine, by the substitution of chlorine for hydrogen in the 2-position of the purine ring. The chemical name of cladribine is 2-chloro-2\u2032-deoxy-adenosine. The structural formula is shown below: Cladribine is stable at slightly basic and at neutral pH. The main degradation pathway is hydrolysis and at acidic pH significant decomposition occurs with time. The ionization behavior of the molecule over the pH range 0 to 12 is characterized by a single pKa of approximately 1.21. Cladribine tablets are provided as 10 mg tablet for oral use. Each 10 mg tablet contains cladribine as an active ingredient and magnesium stearate and sorbitol as inactive ingredients. Cladribine tablets also contain hydroxypropyl betadex."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been fully elucidated but is thought to involve cytotoxic effects on B and T lymphocytes through impairment of DNA synthesis, resulting in depletion of lymphocytes. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cladribine tablets causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment cycle and were lower with each additional treatment cycle. At the end of Year 2, 2% of patients continued to have absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter. The median time to recovery from lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Cladribine is a prodrug that becomes active upon phosphorylation to its 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd-ATP) metabolite. The pharmacokinetic parameters presented below were assessed following oral administration of cladribine 10 mg, unless otherwise specified. The cladribine mean maximum concentration (C max ) was in the range of 22 to 29 ng/ mL and corresponding mean AUC was in the range of 80 to 101 ng\u00b7h/mL. The C max and AUC of cladribine increased proportionally across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg. No accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma was observed after repeated dosing. Absorption The bioavailability of cladribine was approximately 40%. Following fasted administration of cladribine, the median time to maximum concentration (T max ) was 0.5 h (range 0.5 to 1.5 hours). Effect of Food Following administration of cladribine with a high fat meal, the geometric mean C max decreased by 29% and AUC was unchanged. The T max was prolonged to 1.5 hours (range 1 to 3 hours). This difference is not expected to be clinically significant. Distribution Cladribine mean apparent volume of distribution ranges from 480 to 490 liters. The plasma protein binding of cladribine is 20% and is independent of concentration, in vitro . Intracellular concentrations of cladribine and/or its metabolites in human lymphocytes were approximately 30 to 40 times extracellular, in vitro . Cladribine has the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A cerebrospinal fluid/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.25 was observed in cancer patients. Elimination Cladribine estimated terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. The intracellular half-life of the cladribine phosphorylated metabolites cladribine monophosphate (Cd-AMP) is 15 hours and Cd- ATP is 10 hours. Cladribine estimated median apparent renal clearance is 22.2 liter per hour and non-renal clearance is 23.4 liter per hour. Metabolism Cladribine is a prodrug that is phosphorylated to Cd-AMP by deoxycytidine kinase (and also by deoxyguanosine kinase in the mitochondria) in lymphocytes. Cd-AMP is further phosphorylated to cladribine diphosphate (Cd-ADP) and the active moiety Cd-ATP. The dephosphorylation and deactivation of Cd-AMP is catalyzed by cytoplasmic 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-Ntase). The metabolism of cladribine in whole blood has not been fully characterized. However, extensive whole blood and negligible hepatic enzyme metabolism was observed, in vitro. Excretion After administration of 10 mg oral cladribine in MS patients, 28.5 [20] (mean [SD]) percent of the dose was excreted unchanged via the renal route. Renal clearance exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating active renal secretion of cladribine. Specific Populations No studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cladribine in elderly or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cladribine based on age (range 18 to 65 years) or gender. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine is unknown. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal clearance of cladribine was shown to be dependent on creatinine clearance (CL CR ). No dedicated studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment, however patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR of 60 mL to below 90 mL per minute) were included in Study 1. A pooled pharmacokinetic analysis estimated a decrease of 18% in total clearance in a typical subject with a CL CR of 65 mL per minute leading to an increase in cladribine exposure of 25%. Clinical experience in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e., CL CR below 60 mL per minute) is limited [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in cladribine pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with pantoprazole or interferon beta-1a. No clinically significant differences in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics were observed when a combined oral hormonal contraceptive (containing 150 mcg levonorgestrel and 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) was used concomitantly with cladribine. In Vitro Studies It has been reported that lamivudine can inhibit the phosphorylation of cladribine intracellularly. Potential competition for intracellular phosphorylation exists between cladribine and compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Cladribine is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes and does not show significant potential to act as inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Cladribine has no clinically meaningful inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Cladribine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3). Inhibition of BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract may increase the oral bioavailability and systemic exposure of cladribine. Intracellular distribution and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3 transporter inhibitors. 12.6 Hydroxypropyl Betadex-Related Complex Formation Cladribine tablets contain hydroxypropyl betadex that may be available for complex formation with the active ingredients of other drugs. Complex formation between free hydroxypropyl betadex, released from the cladribine tablet formulation, and concomitant ibuprofen, furosemide, and gabapentin was observed. Concomitant use with cladribine tablets may increase the bioavailability of other drugs (especially agents with low solubility), which may increase the risk or severity of adverse reactions [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

Cladribine was positive for clastogenicity in an in vitro mammalian cell assay, in the absence and presence of metabolic activation, and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Impairment of Fertility When cladribine (0, 1, 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) was administered by subcutaneous injection to male mice prior to and during mating to untreated females, no effects on fertility were observed. However, an increase in non-motile sperm was observed at the highest dose tested. In female mice, administration of cladribine (0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day) by subcutaneous injection prior to and during mating to untreated males and continuing to gestation day 6 caused an increase in embryolethality at the highest dose tested. In monkeys administered cladribine (0, 0.15, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection intermittently (7 consecutive daily doses followed by 21 days of non-dosing per cycle) for one year, testicular degeneration was observed at the highest dose tested."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of cladribine tablets was demonstrated in a 96-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing forms of MS (Study 1; NCT00213135). Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median age was 39 years (range 18 to 65) and the female-to-male ratio was approximately 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study enrollment was 8.7 years, and the median baseline neurological disability based on Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score across all treatment groups was 3. Over two thirds of the study patients were treatment-naive for drugs used to treat relapsing forms of MS. 1,326 patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dosage of cladribine 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg per kg body weight (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. Patients randomized to the 3.5 mg per kg cumulative dose received a first treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the first year and a second treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the second year [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients randomized to the 5.25 mg per kg cumulative dose received additional treatment at Weeks 9 and 13 of the first year. Higher cumulative doses did not add any clinically meaningful benefit, but were associated with a higher incidence in grade 3 lymphopenia or higher (44.9% in the 5.25 mg per kg group vs. 25.6% in the 3.5 mg per kg group). Ninety-two percent of patients treated with cladribine 3.5 mg per kg and 87% of patients receiving placebo completed the full 96 weeks of the study. The primary outcome of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Additional outcome measures included the proportion of patients with confirmed disability progression, the time to first qualifying relapse, the mean number of MRI T1 Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, and new or enlarging MRI T2 hyperintense lesions. Disability progression was measured in terms of a 3-month sustained change in EDSS score of at least one point, if baseline EDSS score was between 0.5 and 4.5 inclusively, or at least 1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was at least 5, over a period of at least 3 months. Cladribine 3.5 mg per kg significantly lowered the annualized relapse rate. The results from Study 1 are presented in Table 4. Table 4 Clinical Outcomes in Study 1 (96 Weeks) - Primary and Secondary Endpoints Endpoints Cladribine Cumulative Dose 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) Placebo (n = 437) Clinical Endpoints Annualized relapse rate (ARR) 0.14* 0.33 Relative reduction in ARR 58% Proportion of patients without relapse 81%** 63% Time to 3-month confirmed EDSS progression, HR 0.67** Proportion of patients with 3-month EDSS progression 13% 19% MRI Endpoints Median Number of Active T1 Gd+ Lesions 0* 0.33 Median Number of Active T2 Lesions 0* 0.67 * p < 0.001 compared to placebo ** nominal p < 0.05 compared to placebo HR: Hazard Ratio"

Serious neurological toxicity (including irreversible paraparesis and quadraparesis) has been reported in patients who received cladribine injection by continuous infusion at high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia). Neurologic toxicity appears to demonstrate a dose relationship; however, severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Acute nephrotoxicity has been observed with high doses of cladribine (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia), especially when given concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies."

      "DESCRIPTION Cladribine Injection, USP (also commonly known as 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine) is a synthetic antineoplastic agent for continuous intravenous infusion. It is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution. Cladribine Injection, USP is available in single-use vials containing 10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine, a chlorinated purine nucleoside analog. Each mL of cladribine injection, USP contains 1 mg of the active ingredient and 9 mg (0.15 mEq) of sodium chloride as an inactive ingredient. The solution has a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0. Phosphoric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added to adjust the pH to 6.3 \u00b1 0.3. The chemical name for cladribine is 2-chloro-6-amino-9-(2-deoxy-\u00df-D- erythro -pentofuranosyl)purine and the structure is represented below: Molecular Formula = C 10 H 12 ClN 5 O 3 Molecular Weight = 285.69 structure"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity The selective toxicity of 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine towards certain normal and malignant lymphocyte and monocyte populations is based on the relative activities of deoxycytidine kinase and deoxynucleotidase. Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane. In cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). Since 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in lymphocytes and monocytes, 2-CdAMP accumulates intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide, 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP). It is postulated that cells with high deoxycytidine kinase and low deoxynucleotidase activities will be selectively killed by 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine as toxic deoxynucleotides accumulate intracellularly. Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism. There is evidence, also, that 2-CdATP is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA synthesis. Thus, 2-chloro-2\u00b4-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine can be distinguished from other chemotherapeutic agents affecting purine metabolism in that it is cytotoxic to both actively dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, inhibiting both DNA synthesis and repair. Pharmacokinetics In a clinical investigation, 17 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia and normal renal function were treated for 7 days with the recommended treatment regimen of cladribine (0.09 mg/kg/day) by continuous intravenous infusion. The mean steady-state serum concentration was estimated to be 5.7 ng/mL with an estimated systemic clearance of 663.5 mL/h/kg when cladribine was given by continuous infusion over 7 days. In Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, there does not appear to be a relationship between serum concentrations and ultimate clinical outcome. In another study, 8 patients with hematologic malignancies received a two (2) hour infusion of cladribine (0.12 mg/kg). The mean end-of-infusion plasma cladribine concentration was 48 \u00b1 19 ng/mL. For 5 of these patients, the disappearance of cladribine could be described by either a biphasic or triphasic decline. For these patients with normal renal function, the mean terminal half-life was 5.4 hours. Mean values for clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 978 \u00b1 422 mL/h/kg and 4.5 \u00b1 2.8 L/kg, respectively. Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous administration declines multi-exponentially with an average half-life of 6.7 + 2.5 hours. In general, the apparent volume of distribution of cladribine is approximately 9 L/kg, indicating an extensive distribution in body tissues. Cladribine penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid. One report indicates that concentrations are approximately 25% of those in plasma. Cladribine is bound approximately 20% to plasma proteins. Except for some understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity, no other information is available on the metabolism of cladribine in humans. An average of 18% of the administered dose has been reported to be excreted in urine of patients with solid tumors during a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of 3.5 to 8.1 mg/m 2 /day of cladribine. The effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the elimination of cladribine has not been investigated in humans."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Two single-center open label studies of cladribine have been conducted in patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia with evidence of active disease requiring therapy. In the study conducted at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Study A), 89 patients were treated with a single course of cladribine given by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. In the study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Study B), 35 patients were treated with a 7 day continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine at a comparable dose of 3.6 mg/m 2 /day. A complete response (CR) required clearing of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of hairy cells and recovery of the hemoglobin to 12 g/dL, platelet count to 100 x 10 9 /L, and absolute neutrophil count to 1500 x 10 6 /L. A good partial response (GPR) required the same hematologic parameters as a complete response, and that fewer than 5% hairy cells remain in the bone marrow. A partial response (PR) required that hairy cells in the bone marrow be decreased by at least 50% from baseline and the same response for hematologic parameters as for complete response. A pathologic relapse was defined as an increase in bone marrow hairy cells to 25% of pretreatment levels. A clinical relapse was defined as the recurrence of cytopenias, specifically, decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 2 g/dL, ANC \u2265 25% or platelet counts \u2265 50,000. Patients who met the criteria for a complete response but subsequently were found to have evidence of bone marrow hairy cells (<25% of pretreatment levels) were reclassified as partial responses and were not considered to be complete responses with relapse. Among patients evaluable for efficacy (N=106), using the hematologic and bone marrow response criteria described above, the complete response rates in patients treated with cladribine were 65% and 68% for Study A and Study B, respectively, yielding a combined complete response rate of 66%. Overall response rates (i.e., Complete plus Good Partial plus Partial Responses) were 89% and 86% in Study A and Study B, respectively, for a combined overall response rate of 88% in evaluable patients treated with cladribine. Using an intent-to-treat analysis (N=123) and further requiring no evidence of splenomegaly as a criterion for CR (i.e., no palpable spleen on physical examination and \u2264 13 cm on CT scan), the complete response rates for Study A and Study B were 54% and 53%, respectively, giving a combined CR rate of 54%. The overall response rates (CR + GPR + PR) were 90% and 85%, for Studies A and B, respectively, yielding a combined overall response rate of 89%. RESPONSE RATES TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA CR Overall Evaluable Patients N=106 66% 88% Intent-to-treat Population N=123 54% 89% In these studies, 60% of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy for Hairy Cell Leukemia or had undergone splenectomy as the only prior treatment and were receiving cladribine as a first-line treatment. The remaining 40% of the patients received cladribine as a second-line treatment, having been treated previously with other agents, including \u03b1-interferon and/or deoxycoformycin. The overall response rate for patients without prior chemotherapy was 92%, compared with 84% for previously treated patients. Cladribine is active in previously treated patients; however, retrospective analysis suggests that the overall response rate is decreased in patients previously treated with splenectomy or deoxycoformycin and in patients refractory to \u03b1-interferon. OVERALL RESPONSE RATES (CR + GPR + PR) TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA OVERALL RESPONSE (N=123) NR+ RELAPSE No Prior Chemotherapy 68/74 92% 6 + 4 14% Any Prior Chemotherapy 41/49 84% 8 + 3 22% Previous Splenectomy 32/41 * 78% 9 + 1 24% Previous Interferon 40/48 83% 8 + 3 23% Interferon Refractory 6/11 * 55% 5 + 2 64% Previous Deoxycoformycin 3/6 * 50% 3 + 1 66% NR = No Response * P<0.05 After a reversible decline, normalization of peripheral blood counts (Hemoglobin >12 g/dL, Platelets >100 x 10 9 /L, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >1500 x 10 6 /L) was achieved by 92% of evaluable patients. The median time to normalization of peripheral counts was 9 weeks from the start of treatment (Range: 2 to 72). The median time to normalization of Platelet Count was 2 weeks, the median time to normalization of ANC was 5 weeks and the median time to normalization of Hemoglobin was 8 weeks. With normalization of Platelet Count and Hemoglobin, requirements for platelet and RBC transfusions were abolished after Months 1 and 2, respectively, in those patients with complete response. Platelet recovery may be delayed in a minority of patients with severe baseline thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to normalization of ANC, a trend toward a reduced incidence of infection was seen after the third month, when compared to the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy (see also WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA TIME TO NORMALIZATION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNTS Parameter Median Time to Normalization of Count Day 1 = First day of infusion Platelet Count 2 weeks Absolute Neutrophil Count 5 weeks Hemoglobin 8 weeks ANC, Hemoglobin and Platelet Count 9 weeks For patients achieving a complete response, the median time to response (i.e., absence of hairy cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood together with normalization of peripheral blood parameters), measured from treatment start, was approximately 4 months. Since bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were frequently not performed at the time of peripheral blood normalization, the median time to complete response may actually be shorter than that which was recorded. At the time of data cut- off, the median duration of complete response was greater than 8 months and ranged to 25+ months. Among 93 responding patients, seven had shown evidence of disease progression at the time of the data cut-off. In four of these patients, disease was limited to the bone marrow without peripheral blood abnormalities (pathologic progression), while in three patients there were also peripheral blood abnormalities (clinical progression). Seven patients who did not respond to a first course of cladribine received a second course of therapy. In the five patients who had adequate follow-up, additional courses did not appear to improve their overall response."

      "WARNINGS Due to increased risk of infection in the setting of immunosuppression with chemotherapy including cladribine, it is recommended not to administer live attenuated vaccines to patients receiving Cladribine Injection. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been commonly observed in patients treated with cladribine, especially at high doses. At initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had hematologic impairment as a manifestation of active Hairy Cell Leukemia. Following treatment with cladribine, further hematologic impairment occurred before recovery of peripheral blood counts began. During the first two weeks after treatment initiation, mean Platelet Count, ANC, and Hemoglobin concentration declined and subsequently increased with normalization of mean counts by Day 12, Week 5 and Week 8, respectively. The myelosuppressive effects of cladribine were most notable during the first month following treatment. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients received transfusions with RBCs and 14% received transfusions with platelets during Month 1. Careful hematologic monitoring, especially during the first 4 to 8 weeks after treatment with cladribine, is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fever (T \u2265 100\u02da F) was associated with the use of cladribine in approximately two-thirds of patients (131/196) in the first month of therapy. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with parenteral antibiotics. Overall, 47% (93/196) of all patients had fever in the setting of neutropenia (ANC \u2264 1000), including 62 patients (32%) with severe neutropenia (i.e., ANC \u2264 500). In a Phase I investigational study using cladribine in high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) as part of a bone marrow transplant conditioning regimen, which also included high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, acute nephrotoxicity and delayed onset neurotoxicity were observed. Thirty-one (31) poor-risk patients with drug-resistant acute leukemia in relapse (29 cases) or non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (2 cases) received cladribine for 7 to 14 days prior to bone marrow transplantation. During infusion, 8 patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. While the bone marrow was initially cleared of all hematopoietic elements, including tumor cells, leukemia eventually recurred in all treated patients. Within 7 to 13 days after starting treatment with cladribine, 6 patients (19%) developed manifestations of renal dysfunction (e.g., acidosis, anuria, elevated serum creatinine, etc.) and 5 required dialysis. Several of these patients were also being treated with other medications having known nephrotoxic potential. Renal dysfunction was reversible in 2 of these patients. In the 4 patients whose renal function had not recovered at the time of death, autopsies were performed; in 2 of these, evidence of tubular damage was noted. Eleven (11) patients (35%) experienced delayed onset neurologic toxicity. In the majority, this was characterized by progressive irreversible motor weakness (paraparesis/quadriparesis) of the upper and/or lower extremities, first noted 35 to 84 days after starting high dose therapy with cladribine. Non-invasive testing (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) was consistent with demyelinating disease. Severe neurologic toxicity has also been noted with high doses of another drug in this class. Axonal peripheral polyneuropathy was observed in a dose escalation study at the highest dose levels (approximately 4 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) in patients not receiving cyclophosphamide or total body irradiation. Severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. In patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia treated with the recommended treatment regimen (0.09 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days), there have been no reports of nephrologic toxicities. Serious (e.g. respiratory infection, pneumonia and viral skin infections), including fatal infections (e.g. sepsis) were reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Of the 196 Hairy Cell Leukemia patients entered in the two trials, there were 8 deaths following treatment. Of these, 6 were of infectious etiology, including 3 pneumonias, and 2 occurred in the first month following cladribine therapy. Of the 8 deaths, 6 occurred in previously treated patients who were refractory to \u03b1-interferon. Benzyl alcohol is a constituent of the recommended diluent for the 7-day infusion solution. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \u201cGasping Syndrome\u201d in premature infants (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pregnancy Category D Cladribine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Although there is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans due to cladribine, other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis have been reported to be teratogenic in humans. Cladribine is teratogenic in animals. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with cladribine. If cladribine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Cladribine is teratogenic in mice and rabbits and consequently has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. A significant increase in fetal variations was observed in mice receiving 1.5 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m 2 ) and increased resorptions, reduced litter size and increased fetal malformations were observed when mice received 3 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m 2 ). Fetal death and malformations were observed in rabbits that received 3 mg/kg/day (33 mg/m 2 ). No fetal effects were seen in mice at 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/m 2 ) or in rabbits at 1 mg/kg/day (11 mg/m 2 )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Cladribine is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Development of acute renal insufficiency in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described. Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic insufficiency (see WARNINGS ). Rare cases of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden. Cladribine must be diluted in designated intravenous solutions prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Laboratory Tests During and following treatment, the patient\u2019s hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 x 10 9 /L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1500 x 10 6 /L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8. After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine. Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies. Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated. Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with cladribine. Caution should be exercised if cladribine is administered before, after, or in conjunction with other drugs known to cause immunosuppression or myelosuppression (see WARNINGS ). Carcinogenesis No animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cladribine. However, its carcinogenic potential cannot be excluded based on demonstrated genotoxicity of cladribine. Mutagenesis As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage. In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cladribine was not mutagenic in vitro (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. However, cladribine was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility The effect on human fertility is unknown. When administered intravenously to Cynomolgus monkeys, cladribine has been shown to cause suppression of rapidly generating cells, including testicular cells. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects; Pregnancy Category D See WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), 3 of 7 patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study 1 (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients."

      "Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), 3 of 7 patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study 1 (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS )."
    ],
    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients."

In Month 1 of the Hairy Cell Leukemia clinical trials, severe neutropenia was noted in 70% of patients, fever in 69%, and infection was documented in 28%. Most non-hematologic adverse experiences were mild to moderate in severity. Myelosuppression was frequently observed during the first month after starting treatment. Neutropenia (ANC < 500 x 10 6 /L) was noted in 70% of patients, compared with 26% in whom it was present initially. Severe anemia (Hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL) developed in 37% of patients, compared with 10% initially and thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 20 x 10 9 /L) developed in 12% of patients, compared to 4% in whom it was noted initially. During the first month, 54 of 196 patients (28%) exhibited documented evidence of infection. Serious infections (e.g., septicemia, pneumonia) were reported in 6% of all patients; the remainder were mild or moderate. Several deaths were attributable to infection and/or complications related to the underlying disease. During the second month, the overall rate of documented infection was 6%; these infections were mild to moderate and no severe systemic infections were seen. After the third month, the monthly incidence of infection was either less than or equal to that of the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. During the first month, 11% of patients experienced severe fever (i.e., \u2265104\u00b0F). Documented infections were noted in fewer than one-third of febrile episodes. Of the 196 patients studied, 19 were noted to have a documented infection in the month prior to treatment. In the month following treatment, there were 54 episodes of documented infection: 23 (42%) were bacterial, 11 (20%) were viral and 11 (20%) were fungal. Seven (7) of 8 documented episodes of herpes zoster occurred during the month following treatment. Fourteen (14) of 16 episodes of documented fungal infections occurred in the first two months following treatment. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with antibiotics (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Analysis of lymphocyte subsets indicates that treatment with cladribine is associated with prolonged depression of the CD4 counts. Prior to treatment, the mean CD4 count was 766/\u00b5L. The mean CD4 count nadir, which occurred 4 to 6 months following treatment, was 272/\u00b5L. Fifteen (15) months after treatment, mean CD4 counts remained below 500/\u00b5L. CD8 counts behaved similarly, though increasing counts were observed after 9 months. The clinical significance of the prolonged CD4 lymphopenia is unclear. Another event of unknown clinical significance includes the observation of prolonged bone marrow hypocellularity. Bone marrow cellularity of <35% was noted after 4 months in 42 of 124 patients (34%) treated in the two pivotal trials. This hypocellularity was noted as late as day 1010. It is not known whether the hypocellularity is the result of disease related marrow fibrosis or if it is the result of cladribine toxicity. There was no apparent clinical effect on the peripheral blood counts. The vast majority of rashes were mild. Most episodes of nausea were mild, not accompanied by vomiting, and did not require treatment with antiemetics. In patients requiring antiemetics, nausea was easily controlled, most frequently with chlorpromazine. Postmarketing Experience \u200b The following additional adverse reactions have been reported since the drug became commercially available. These adverse reactions have been reported primarily in patients who received multiple courses of cladribine injection: Infections and infestations: Septic shock. Opportunistic infections have occurred in the acute phase of treatment. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Bone marrow suppression with prolonged pancytopenia, including some reports of aplastic anemia; hemolytic anemia (including autoimmune hemolytic anemia), which was reported in patients with lymphoid malignancies, occurring within the first few weeks following treatment. Rare cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Tumor lysis syndrome. Psychiatric disorders : Confusion (including disorientation). Hepatobiliary disorders : Reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases. Nervous System disorders : Depressed level of consciousness, neurological toxicity (including peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy (paralysis), polyneuropathy, paraparesis); however, severe neurotoxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Eye disorders : Conjunctivitis. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (including lung infiltration, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis); in most cases, an infectious etiology was identified. Skin and tissue disorders : Urticaria, hypereosinophilia; Stevens-Johnson. In isolated cases toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with other medications (e.g., allopurinol or antibiotics) known to cause these syndromes. Renal and urinary disorders: Renal failure (including renal failure acute, renal impairment)."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE High doses of cladribine have been associated with: irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), acute nephrotoxicity, and severe bone marrow suppression resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS ). There is no known specific antidote to overdosage. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of cladribine, careful observation and appropriate supportive measures. It is not known whether the drug can be removed from the circulation by dialysis or hemofiltration. When used in other clinical settings the following ADRs were reported: bacteremia, cellulitis, localized infection, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (with bleeding or petechiae), phlebitis, purpura, crepitations, localized edema and edema. For a description of adverse reactions associated with use of high doses in non-Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, see WARNINGS ."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual Dose The recommended dose and schedule of cladribine for active Hairy Cell Leukemia is as a single course given by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. Deviations from this dosage regimen are not advised. If the patient does not respond to the initial course of cladribine for Hairy Cell Leukemia, it is unlikely that they will benefit from additional courses. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity or renal toxicity occurs (see WARNINGS ). Specific risk factors predisposing to increased toxicity from cladribine have not been defined. In view of the known toxicities of agents of this class, it would be prudent to proceed carefully in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency or severe bone marrow impairment of any etiology. Patients should be monitored closely for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solutions Cladribine must be diluted with the designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of cladribine solutions. To prepare a single daily dose Cladribine injection should be passed through a sterile 0.22\u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag, prior to each daily infusion. Add the calculated dose (0.09 mg/kg or 0.09 mL/kg) of cladribine through a sterile filter to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Infuse continuously over 24 hours. Repeat daily for a total of 7 consecutive days. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended because of increased degradation of cladribine. Admixtures of cladribine are chemically and physically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal room fluorescent light in Baxter Viaflex\u00ae\u2020 PVC infusion containers. Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised . Dose of Cladribine Injection Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 24 hour infusion method 1 (day) x 0.09 mg/kg 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection 500 mL To prepare a 7 day infusion The 7 day infusion solution should only be prepared with Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved). In order to minimize the risk of microbial contamination, both cladribine injection and the diluent should be passed through a sterile 0.22\u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter as each solution is being introduced into the infusion reservoir. First add the calculated dose of cladribine (7 days x 0.09 mg/kg or mL/kg) to the infusion reservoir through the sterile filter. Then add a calculated amount of Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved) also through the filter to bring the total volume of the solution to 100 mL. After completing solution preparation, clamp off the line, disconnect and discard the filter. Aseptically aspirate air bubbles from the reservoir as necessary using the syringe and a dry second sterile filter or a sterile vent filter assembly. Reclamp the line and discard the syringe and filter assembly. Infuse continuously over 7 days. Solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection for individuals weighing more than 85 kg may have reduced preservative effectiveness due to greater dilution of the benzyl alcohol preservative. Admixtures for the 7 day infusion have demonstrated acceptable chemical and physical stability for at least 7 days in the SIMS Deltec MEDICATION CASSETTE\u2122 Reservoir \u2021. Dose of Cladribine Injection Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 7 day infusion method (use sterile 0.22\u00b5m filter when preparing infusion solution) 7 (days) x 0.09 mg/kg Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9% benzyl alcohol) q.s. to 100 mL Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Solutions containing cladribine should not be mixed with other intravenous drugs or additives or infused simultaneously via a common intravenous line, since compatibility testing has not been performed. Preparations containing benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates (see WARNINGS ). Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Once diluted, solutions of cladribine should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C) for no more than 8 hours prior to start of administration. Vials of cladribine are for single-use only. Any unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner (see Handling and Disposal ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A precipitate may occur during the exposure of cladribine to low temperatures; it may be resolubilized by allowing the solution to warm naturally to room temperature and by shaking vigorously. DO NOT HEAT OR MICROWAVE . Chemical Stability of Vials When stored in refrigerated conditions between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 F) protected from light, unopened vials of cladribine are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package. Freezing does not adversely affect the solution. If freezing occurs, thaw naturally to room temperature. DO NOT heat or microwave. Once thawed, the vial of cladribine is stable until expiry if refrigerated. DO NOT refreeze. Once diluted, solutions containing cladribine should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C) for no more than 8 hours prior to administration. Handling and Disposal The potential hazards associated with cytotoxic agents are well established and proper precautions should be taken when handling, preparing, and administering cladribine. The use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended. If cladribine contacts the skin or mucous membranes, wash the involved surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. (2-8) There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. Refer to your institution\u2019s guidelines and all applicable state/local regulations for disposal of cytotoxic waste."

      "WARNING Cladribine injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy. Suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated. This is usually reversible and appears to be dose dependent. Serious neurological toxicity (including irreversible paraparesis and quadraparesis) has been reported in patients who received cladribine injection by continuous infusion at high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia). Neurologic toxicity appears to demonstrate a dose relationship; however, severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Acute nephrotoxicity has been observed with high doses of cladribine (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia), especially when given concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies."

      "DESCRIPTION Cladribine Injection, USP (also commonly known as 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine) is a synthetic antineoplastic agent for continuous intravenous infusion. It is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution. Cladribine injection, USP is available in single-dose vials containing 10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine, a chlorinated purine nucleoside analog. Each milliliter of cladribine injection, USP contains 1 mg of the active ingredient and 9 mg (0.15 mEq) of sodium chloride as an inactive ingredient. The solution has a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0. Phosphoric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added to adjust the pH to 6.3\u00b10.3. The chemical name for cladribine is 2-chloro-6-amino-9-(2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-erythropento-furanosyl) purine and the structure is represented below: Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity The selective toxicity of 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy-\u03b2-D-adenosine towards certain normal and malignant lymphocyte and monocyte populations is based on the relative activities of deoxycytidine kinase and deoxynucleotidase. Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane. In cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). Since 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in lymphocytes and monocytes, 2-CdAMP accumulates intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide, 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP). It is postulated that cells with high deoxycytidine kinase and low deoxynucleotidase activities will be selectively killed by 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine as toxic deoxynucleotides accumulate intracellularly. Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism. There is evidence, also, that 2-CdATP is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA synthesis. Thus, 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine can be distinguished from other chemotherapeutic agents affecting purine metabolism in that it is cytotoxic to both actively dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, inhibiting both DNA synthesis and repair. Pharmacokinetics In a clinical investigation, 17 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia and normal renal function were treated for 7 days with the recommended treatment regimen of cladribine injection (0.09 mg/kg/day) by continuous intravenous infusion. The mean steady-state serum concentration was estimated to be 5.7 ng/mL with an estimated systemic clearance of 663.5 mL/h/kg when cladribine was given by continuous infusion over 7 days. In Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, there does not appear to be a relationship between serum concentrations and ultimate clinical outcome. In another study, 8 patients with hematologic malignancies received a two (2) hour infusion of cladribine injection (0.12 mg/kg). The mean end-of-infusion plasma cladribine concentration was 48\u00b119 ng/mL. For 5 of these patients, the disappearance of cladribine could be described by either a biphasic or triphasic decline. For these patients with normal renal function, the mean terminal half-life was 5.4 hours. Mean values for clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 978\u00b1422 mL/h/kg and 4.5\u00b12.8 L/kg, respectively. Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous administration declines multi-exponentially with an average half-life of 6.7 +/- 2.5 hours. In general, the apparent volume of distribution of cladribine is approximately 9 L/kg, indicating an extensive distribution in body tissues. Cladribine penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid. One report indicates that concentrations are approximately 25% of those in plasma. Cladribine is bound approximately 20% to plasma proteins. Except for some understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity, no other information is available on the metabolism of cladribine in humans. An average of 18% of the administered dose has been reported to be excreted in urine of patients with solid tumors during a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of 3.5\u20138.1 mg/m 2 /day of cladribine. The effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the elimination of cladribine has not been investigated in humans."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Two single-center open label studies of cladribine injection have been conducted in patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia with evidence of active disease requiring therapy. In the study conducted at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Study A), 89 patients were treated with a single course of cladribine injection given by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. In the study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Study B), 35 patients were treated with a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine injection at a comparable dose of 3.6 mg/m 2 /day. A complete response (CR) required clearing of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of hairy cells and recovery of the hemoglobin to 12 g/dL, platelet count to 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and absolute neutrophil count to 1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L. A good partial response (GPR) required the same hematologic parameters as a complete response, and that fewer than 5% hairy cells remain in the bone marrow. A partial response (PR) required that hairy cells in the bone marrow be decreased by at least 50% from baseline and the same response for hematologic parameters as for complete response. A pathologic relapse was defined as an increase in bone marrow hairy cells to 25% of pretreatment levels. A clinical relapse was defined as the recurrence of cytopenias, specifically, decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 2 g/dL, ANC \u2265 25% or platelet counts \u2265 50,000. Patients who met the criteria for a complete response but subsequently were found to have evidence of bone marrow hairy cells (< 25% of pretreatment levels) were reclassified as partial responses and were not considered to be complete responses with relapse. Among patients evaluable for efficacy (N=106), using the hematologic and bone marrow response criteria described above, the complete response rates in patients treated with cladribine injection were 65% and 68% for Study A and Study B, respectively, yielding a combined complete response rate of 66%. Overall response rates (i.e., Complete plus Good Partial plus Partial Responses) were 89% and 86% in Study A and Study B, respectively, for a combined overall response rate of 88% in evaluable patients treated with cladribine injection. Using an intent-to-treat analysis (N=123) and further requiring no evidence of splenomegaly as a criterion for CR (i.e., no palpable spleen on physical examination and \u2264 13 cm on CT scan), the complete response rates for Study A and Study B were 54% and 53%, respectively, giving a combined CR rate of 54%. The overall response rates (CR + GPR + PR) were 90% and 85%, for Studies A and B, respectively, yielding a combined overall response rate of 89%. RESPONSE RATES TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA CR Overall Evaluable Patients N=106 66% 88% Intent-to-treat Population N=123 54% 89% In these studies, 60% of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy for Hairy Cell Leukemia or had undergone splenectomy as the only prior treatment and were receiving cladribine as a first-line treatment. The remaining 40% of the patients received cladribine as a second-line treatment, having been treated previously with other agents, including \u03b1-interferon and/or deoxycoformycin. The overall response rate for patients without prior chemotherapy was 92%, compared with 84% for previously treated patients. Cladribine is active in previously treated patients; however, retrospective analysis suggests that the overall response rate is decreased in patients previously treated with splenectomy or deoxycoformycin and in patients refractory to \u03b1-interferon. OVERALL RESPONSE RATES (CR + GPR + PR) TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA OVERALL RESPONSE (N = 123) NR + RELAPSE NR = No Response No Prior Chemotherapy 68/74 92% 6 + 4 14% Any Prior Chemotherapy 41/49 84% 8 + 3 22% Previous Splenectomy 32/41 P < 0.05 78% 9 + 1 24% Previous Interferon 40/48 83% 8 + 3 23% Interferon Refractory 6/11 55% 5 + 2 64% Previous Deoxycoformycin 3/6 50% 3 + 1 66% After a reversible decline, normalization of peripheral blood counts (Hemoglobin >12.0 g/dL, Platelets >100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L) was achieved by 92% of evaluable patients. The median time to normalization of peripheral counts was 9 weeks from the start of treatment (Range: 2 to 72). The median time to normalization of Platelet Count was two weeks, the median time to normalization of ANC was 5 weeks and the median time to normalization of Hemoglobin was 8 weeks. With normalization of Platelet Count and Hemoglobin, requirements for platelet and RBC transfusions were abolished after Months 1 and 2, respectively, in those patients with complete response. Platelet recovery may be delayed in a minority of patients with severe baseline thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to normalization of ANC, a trend toward a reduced incidence of infection was seen after the third month, when compared to the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. (see also WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) cladribine TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA TIME TO NORMALIZATION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNTS Parameter Median Time to Normalization of Count Day 1 = First day of infusion Platelet Count 2 weeks Absolute Neutrophil Count 5 weeks Hemoglobin 8 weeks ANC, Hemoglobin and Platelet Count 9 weeks For patients achieving a complete response, the median time to response (i.e., absence of hairy cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood together with normalization of peripheral blood parameters), measured from treatment start, was approximately 4 months. Since bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were frequently not performed at the time of peripheral blood normalization, the median time to complete response may actually be shorter than that which was recorded. At the time of data cut-off, the median duration of complete response was greater than 8 months and ranged to 25+ months. Among 93 responding patients, seven had shown evidence of disease progression at the time of the data cut-off. In four of these patients, disease was limited to the bone marrow without peripheral blood abnormalities (pathologic progression), while in three patients there were also peripheral blood abnormalities (clinical progression). Seven patients who did not respond to a first course of cladribine received a second course of therapy. In the five patients who had adequate follow-up, additional courses did not appear to improve their overall response."

      "WARNINGS Due to increased risk of infection in the setting of immunosuppression with chemotherapy including cladribine, it is recommended not to administer live attenuated vaccines to patients receiving cladribine injection. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been commonly observed in patients treated with cladribine, especially at high doses. At initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had hematologic impairment as a manifestation of active Hairy Cell Leukemia. Following treatment with cladribine, further hematologic impairment occurred before recovery of peripheral blood counts began. During the first two weeks after treatment initiation, mean Platelet Count, ANC, and Hemoglobin concentration declined and subsequently increased with normalization of mean counts by Day 12, Week 5 and Week 8, respectively. The myelosuppressive effects of cladribine were most notable during the first month following treatment. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients received transfusions with RBCs and 14% received transfusions with platelets during Month 1. Careful hematologic monitoring, especially during the first 4 to 8 weeks after treatment with cladribine injection, is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fever (T \u2265 100\u00b0F) was associated with the use of cladribine in approximately two-thirds of patients (131/196) in the first month of therapy. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with parenteral antibiotics. Overall, 47% (93/196) of all patients had fever in the setting of neutropenia (ANC \u2264 1000), including 62 patients (32%) with severe neutropenia (i.e., ANC \u2264 500). In a Phase I investigational study using cladribine in high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) as part of a bone marrow transplant conditioning regimen, which also included high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, acute nephrotoxicity and delayed onset neurotoxicity were observed. Thirty-one (31) poor-risk patients with drug-resistant acute leukemia in relapse (29 cases) or non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (2 cases) received cladribine for 7 to 14 days prior to bone marrow transplantation. During infusion, 8 patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. While the bone marrow was initially cleared of all hematopoietic elements, including tumor cells, leukemia eventually recurred in all treated patients. Within 7 to 13 days after starting treatment with cladribine, 6 patients (19%) developed manifestations of renal dysfunction (e.g., acidosis, anuria, elevated serum creatinine, etc.) and 5 required dialysis. Several of these patients were also being treated with other medications having known nephrotoxic potential. Renal dysfunction was reversible in 2 of these patients. In the 4 patients whose renal function had not recovered at the time of death, autopsies were performed; in 2 of these, evidence of tubular damage was noted. Eleven (11) patients (35%) experienced delayed onset neurologic toxicity. In the majority, this was characterized by progressive irreversible motor weakness (paraparesis/quadriparesis) of the upper and/or lower extremities, first noted 35 to 84 days after starting high dose therapy with cladribine. Non-invasive testing (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) was consistent with demyelinating disease. Severe neurologic toxicity has also been noted with high doses of another drug in this class. Axonal peripheral polyneuropathy was observed in a dose escalation study at the highest dose levels (approximately 4 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) in patients not receiving cyclophosphamide or total body irradiation. Severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. In patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia treated with the recommended treatment regimen (0.09 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days), there have been no reports of nephrologic toxicities. Serious (e.g. respiratory infection, pneumonia and viral skin infections), including fatal infections (e.g. sepsis) were reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Of the 196 Hairy Cell Leukemia patients entered in the two trials, there were 8 deaths following treatment. Of these, 6 were of infectious etiology, including 3 pneumonias, and 2 occurred in the first month following cladribine therapy. Of the 8 deaths, 6 occurred in previously treated patients who were refractory to \u03b1 interferon. Benzyl alcohol is a constituent of the recommended diluent for the 7-day infusion solution. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Pregnancy Category D Cladribine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Although there is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans due to cladribine, other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis have been reported to be teratogenic in humans. Cladribine is teratogenic in animals. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with cladribine. If cladribine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Cladribine is teratogenic in mice and rabbits and consequently has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. A significant increase in fetal variations was observed in mice receiving 1.5 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m 2 ) and increased resorptions, reduced litter size and increased fetal malformations were observed when mice received 3.0 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m 2 ). Fetal death and malformations were observed in rabbits that received 3.0 mg/kg/day (33.0 mg/m 2 ). No fetal effects were seen in mice at 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/m 2 ) or in rabbits at 1.0 mg/kg/day (11.0 mg/m 2 )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Development of acute renal insufficiency in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described. Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic insufficiency (see WARNINGS ). Rare cases of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden. Cladribine injection must be diluted in designated intravenous solutions prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Laboratory Tests During and following treatment, the patient's hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8. After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine. Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies. Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated. Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with cladribine injection. Caution should be exercised if cladribine injection is administered before, after, or in conjunction with other drugs known to cause immunosuppression or myelosuppression. (see WARNINGS ) Carcinogenesis No animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cladribine. However, its carcinogenic potential cannot be excluded based on demonstrated genotoxicity of cladribine. Mutagenesis As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage. In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cladribine was not mutagenic in vitro (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. However, cladribine was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility The effect on human fertility is unknown. When administered intravenously to Cynomolgus monkeys, cladribine has been shown to cause suppression of rapidly generating cells, including testicular cells. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1\u201321 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), 3 of 7 patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study (1) (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients."

      "Carcinogenesis No animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cladribine. However, its carcinogenic potential cannot be excluded based on demonstrated genotoxicity of cladribine.",
      "Mutagenesis As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage. In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cladribine was not mutagenic in vitro (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. However, cladribine was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test).",

      "Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1\u201321 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), 3 of 7 patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study (1) (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS )."

      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience Adverse drug reactions reported by \u2265 1% of cladribine-treated patients with HCL noted in the HCL clinical dataset (studies K90-091 and L91-048, n=576) are shown in the table below. Adverse Drug Reactions in \u2265 1% of Patients Treated with Cladribine in HCL Clinical Trials System Organ Class Preferred Term Cladribine (n=576) % Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder (see also sections WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Anemia 1 Febrile neutropenia 8 Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 1 Insomnia 3 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 6 Headache 14 Cardiac Disorders Tachycardia 2 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Breath sounds abnormal 4 Cough 7 Dyspnea Dyspnea includes dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, and wheezing 5 Rales 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain Abdominal pain includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain (lower and upper) 4 Constipation 4 Diarrhea 7 Flatulence 1 Nausea 22 Vomiting 9 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Ecchymosis 2 Hyperhidrosis 3 Petechiae 2 Pruritus 2 Rash Rash includes erythema, rash, and rash (macular, macula-papular, papular, pruritic, pustular and erythematous) 16 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders Arthralgia 3 Myalgia 6 Pain Pain includes pain, back pain, chest pain, arthritis pain, bone pain, and pain in extremity 6 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (see also sections WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Administration site reaction Administration site reaction includes administration site reaction, catheter site (cellulitis, erythema, hemorrhage, and pain), and infusion site reaction(erythema, edema, and pain) 11 Asthenia 6 Chills 2 Decreased appetite 8 Fatigue 31 Malaise 5 Muscular weakness 1 Edema peripheral 2 Pyrexia 33 Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications Contusion 1 The following safety data are based on 196 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia: the original cohort of 124 patients plus an additional 72 patients enrolled at the same two centers after the original enrollment cutoff. In Month 1 of the Hairy Cell Leukemia clinical trials, severe neutropenia was noted in 70% of patients, fever in 69%, and infection was documented in 28%. Most non-hematologic adverse experiences were mild to moderate in severity. Myelosuppression was frequently observed during the first month after starting treatment. Neutropenia (ANC < 500 \u00d7 10 6 /L) was noted in 70% of patients, compared with 26% in whom it was present initially. Severe anemia (Hemoglobin < 8.5 g/dL) developed in 37% of patients, compared with 10% initially and thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L) developed in 12% of patients, compared to 4% in whom it was noted initially. During the first month, 54 of 196 patients (28%) exhibited documented evidence of infection. Serious infections (e.g., septicemia, pneumonia) were reported in 6% of all patients; the remainder were mild or moderate. Several deaths were attributable to infection and/or complications related to the underlying disease. During the second month, the overall rate of documented infection was 6%; these infections were mild to moderate and no severe systemic infections were seen. After the third month, the monthly incidence of infection was either less than or equal to that of the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. During the first month, 11% of patients experienced severe fever (i.e., \u2265104\u00b0F). Documented infections were noted in fewer than one-third of febrile episodes. Of the 196 patients studied, 19 were noted to have a documented infection in the month prior to treatment. In the month following treatment, there were 54 episodes of documented infection: 23 (42%) were bacterial, 11 (20%) were viral and 11 (20%) were fungal. Seven (7) of 8 documented episodes of herpes zoster occurred during the month following treatment. Fourteen (14) of 16 episodes of documented fungal infections occurred in the first two months following treatment. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with antibiotics. (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Analysis of lymphocyte subsets indicates that treatment with cladribine is associated with prolonged depression of the CD4 counts. Prior to treatment, the mean CD4 count was 766/\u00b5L. The mean CD4 count nadir, which occurred 4 to 6 months following treatment, was 272/\u00b5L. Fifteen (15) months after treatment, mean CD4 counts remained below 500/\u00b5L. CD8 counts behaved similarly, though increasing counts were observed after 9 months. The clinical significance of the prolonged CD4 lymphopenia is unclear. Another event of unknown clinical significance includes the observation of prolonged bone marrow hypocellularity. Bone marrow cellularity of < 35% was noted after 4 months in 42 of 124 patients (34%) treated in the two pivotal trials. This hypocellularity was noted as late as Day 1010. It is not known whether the hypocellularity is the result of disease related marrow fibrosis or if it is the result of cladribine toxicity. There was no apparent clinical effect on the peripheral blood counts. The vast majority of rashes were mild. Most episodes of nausea were mild, not accompanied by vomiting, and did not require treatment with antiemetics. In patients requiring antiemetics, nausea was easily controlled, most frequently with chlorpromazine. When used in other clinical settings the following ADRs were reported: bacteremia, cellulitis, localized infection, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (with bleeding or petechiae), phlebitis, purpura, crepitations, localized edema and edema. For a description of adverse reactions associated with use of high doses in non-Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, see WARNINGS . Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported since the drug became commercially available. These adverse reactions have been reported primarily in patients who received multiple courses of cladribine injection: Infections and infestations: Septic shock. Opportunistic infections have occurred in the acute phase of treatment. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Bone marrow suppression with prolonged pancytopenia, including some reports of aplastic anemia; hemolytic anemia (including autoimmune hemolytic anemia), which was reported in patients with lymphoid malignancies, occurring within the first few weeks following treatment. Rare cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Tumor lysis syndrome. Psychiatric disorders : Confusion (including disorientation). Hepatobiliary disorders : Reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases. Nervous System disorders : Depressed level of consciousness, neurological toxicity (including peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy (paralysis), polyneuropathy, paraparesis); however, severe neurotoxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Eye disorders : Conjunctivitis. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (including lung infiltration, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis); in most cases, an infectious etiology was identified. Skin and tissue disorders : Urticaria, hypereosinophilia; Stevens-Johnson. In isolated cases toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with other medications (e.g., allopurinol or antibiotics) known to cause these syndromes. Renal and urinary disorders: Renal failure (including renal failure acute, renal impairment)."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE High doses of cladribine have been associated with: irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), acute nephrotoxicity, and severe bone marrow suppression resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS ). There is no known specific antidote to overdosage. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of cladribine, careful observation and appropriate supportive measures. It is not known whether the drug can be removed from the circulation by dialysis or hemofiltration."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual Dose The recommended dose and schedule of cladribine injection, USP for active Hairy Cell Leukemia is as a single course given by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. Deviations from this dosage regimen are not advised. If the patient does not respond to the initial course of cladribine injection, USP for Hairy Cell Leukemia, it is unlikely that they will benefit from additional courses. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity or renal toxicity occurs (see WARNINGS ). Specific risk factors predisposing to increased toxicity from cladribine have not been defined. In view of the known toxicities of agents of this class, it would be prudent to proceed carefully in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency or severe bone marrow impairment of any etiology. Patients should be monitored closely for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solutions Cladribine injection, USP must be diluted with the designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of cladribine injection solutions. To prepare a single daily dose Cladribine injection, USP should be passed through a sterile 0.22\u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag, prior to each daily infusion. Add the calculated dose (0.09 mg/kg or 0.09 mL/kg) of cladribine injection, USP through the sterile filter to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Infuse continuously over 24 hours. Repeat daily for a total of 7 consecutive days. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended because of increased degradation of cladribine. Admixtures of cladribine injection, USP are chemically and physically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal room fluorescent light in Baxter Viaflex \u00ae PVC infusion containers. Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Dose of Cladribine Injection, USP Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 24-hour infusion method 1(day) \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 500 mL To prepare a 7-day infusion The 7-day infusion solution should only be prepared with Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved). In order to minimize the risk of microbial contamination, both cladribine injection, USP and the diluent should be passed through a sterile 0.22 \u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter as each solution is being introduced into the infusion reservoir. First add the calculated dose of cladribine injection, USP (7 days \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg or mL/kg) to the infusion reservoir through the sterile filter. Then add a calculated amount of Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved) also through the filter to bring the total volume of the solution to 100 mL. After completing solution preparation, clamp off the line, disconnect and discard the filter. Aseptically aspirate air bubbles from the reservoir as necessary using the syringe and a dry second sterile filter or a sterile vent filter assembly. Reclamp the line and discard the syringe and filter assembly. Infuse continuously over 7 days. Solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection for individuals weighing more than 85 kg may have reduced preservative effectiveness due to greater dilution of the benzyl alcohol preservative. Admixtures for the 7-day infusion have demonstrated acceptable chemical and physical stability for at least 7 days in the SIMS Deltec MEDICATION CASSETTE\u2122 Reservoir. Dose of Cladribine Injection, USP Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 7-day infusion method (use sterile 0.22\u00b5 filter when preparing infusion solution) 7 (days) \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol) q.s. to 100 mL Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Solutions containing cladribine injection, USP should not be mixed with other intravenous drugs or additives or infused simultaneously via a common intravenous line, since compatibility testing has not been performed. Preparations containing benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates (see WARNINGS ). Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Once diluted, solutions of cladribine injection, USP should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C) for no more than 8 hours prior to start of administration. Vials of cladribine injection, USP are for single-use only. Any unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner (see Handling and Disposal ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A precipitate may occur during the exposure of cladribine injection, USP to low temperatures; it may be resolubilized by allowing the solution to warm naturally to room temperature and by shaking vigorously. DO NOT HEAT OR MICROWAVE. Chemical Stability of Vials When stored in refrigerated conditions between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) protected from light, unopened vials of cladribine injection, USP are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package. Freezing does not adversely affect the solution. If freezing occurs, thaw naturally to room temperature. DO NOT heat or microwave. Once thawed, the vial of cladribine injection, USP is stable until expiry if refrigerated. DO NOT refreeze. Once diluted, solutions containing cladribine injection, USP should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for no more than 8 hours prior to administration. Handling and Disposal The potential hazards associated with cytotoxic agents are well established and proper precautions should be taken when handling, preparing, and administering cladribine injection, USP. The use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended. If cladribine injection, USP contacts the skin or mucous membranes, wash the involved surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. (2\u20138) There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. Refer to your Institution's guidelines and all applicable state/local regulations for disposal of cytotoxic waste."

      "WARNING: Cladribine injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy. Suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated. This is usually reversible and appears to be dose dependent. Serious neurological toxicity (including irreversible paraparesis and quadraparesis) has been reported in patients who received cladribine injection by continuous infusion at high doses (four to nine times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia). Neurologic toxicity appears to demonstrate a dose relationship; however, severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Acute nephrotoxicity has been observed with high doses of cladribine injection (four to nine times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia), especially when given concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies."

      "DESCRIPTION: Cladribine Injection, USP (also commonly known as 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine) is a synthetic antineoplastic agent for continuous intravenous infusion. It is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution. Cladribine injection, USP is available in single-dose vials containing 10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine, a chlorinated purine nucleoside analog. Each milliliter of cladribine injection, USP contains 1 mg of the active ingredient and 9 mg (0.15 mEq) of sodium chloride as an inactive ingredient. The solution has a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0. Phosphoric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added to adjust the pH to 6.3 \u00b1 0.3. The chemical name for cladribine is 2-chloro-6-amino-9-(2-deoxy-\u00df-D-erythropento-furanosyl) purine and the structure is represented below: structure"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity The selective toxicity of 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine towards certain normal and malignant lymphocyte and monocyte populations is based on the relative activities of deoxycytidine kinase and deoxynucleotidase. Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane. In cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). Since 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in lymphocytes and monocytes, 2-CdAMP accumulates intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide,2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP). It is postulated that cells with high deoxycytidine kinase and low deoxynucleotidase activities will be selectively killed by 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine as toxic deoxynucleotides accumulate intracellularly. Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism. There is evidence, also, that 2-CdATP is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA synthesis. Thus, 2-chloro-2\u2019-deoxy-\u00df-D-adenosine can be distinguished from other chemotherapeutic agents affecting purine metabolism in that it is cytotoxic to both actively dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, inhibiting both DNA synthesis and repair. Pharmacokinetics In a clinical investigation, 17 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) and normal renal function were treated for seven days with the recommended treatment regimen of cladribine injection (0.09 mg/kg/day) by continuous intravenous infusion. The mean steady-state serum concentration was estimated to be 5.7 ng/mL with an estimated systemic clearance of 663.5 mL/h/kg when cladribine injection was given by continuous infusion over seven days. In Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, there does not appear to be a relationship between serum concentrations and ultimate clinical outcome. In another study, eight patients with hematologic malignancies received a two (2) hour infusion of cladribine injection (0.12 mg/kg). The mean end-of-infusion plasma cladribine injection concentration was 48 \u00b1 19 ng/mL. For five of these patients, the disappearance of cladribine injection could be described by either a biphasic or triphasic decline. For these patients with normal renal function, the mean terminal half-life was 5.4 hours. Mean values for clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 978 \u00b1 422 mL/h/kg and 4.5 \u00b1 2.8 L/kg, respectively. Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous administration declines multi-exponentially with an average half-life of 6.7 +/- 2.5 hours. In general, the apparent volume of distribution of cladribine is approximately 9 L/kg, indicating an extensive distribution in body tissues. Cladribine penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid. One report indicates that concentrations are approximately 25% of those in plasma. Cladribine injection is bound approximately 20% to plasma proteins. Except for some understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity, no other information is available on the metabolism of cladribine injection in humans. An average of 18% of the administered dose has been reported to be excreted in urine of patients with solid tumors during a five-day continuous intravenous infusion of 3.5 to 8.1 mg/m 2 /day of cladribine injection. The effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the elimination of cladribine has not been investigated in humans.",

      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Two single-center open label studies of cladribine injection have been conducted in patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia with evidence of active disease requiring therapy. In the study conducted at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Study A), 89 patients were treated with a single course of cladribine injection given by continuous intravenous infusion for seven days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. In the study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Study B), 35 patients were treated with a seven-day continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine injection at a comparable dose of 3.6 mg/m 2 /day. A complete response (CR) required clearing of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of hairy cells and recovery of the hemoglobin to 12 g/dL, platelet count to 100 x 10 9 /L, and absolute neutrophil count to 1,500 x 10 6 /L. A good partial response (GPR) required the same hematologic parameters as a complete response, and that fewer than 5% hairy cells remain in the bone marrow. A partial response (PR) required that hairy cells in the bone marrow be decreased by at least 50% from baseline and the same response for hematologic parameters as for complete response. A pathologic relapse was defined as an increase in bone marrow hairy cells to 25% of pretreatment levels. A clinical relapse was defined as the recurrence of cytopenias, specifically, decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 2 g/dL, ANC \u2265 25% or platelet counts \u2265 50,000. Patients who met the criteria for a complete response but subsequently were found to have evidence of bone marrow hairy cells (< 25% of pretreatment levels) were reclassified as partial responses and were not considered to be complete responses with relapse. Among patients evaluable for efficacy (N=106), using the hematologic and bone marrow response criteria described above, the complete response rates in patients treated with cladribine injection were 65% and 68% for Study A and Study B, respectively, yielding a combined complete response rate of 66%. Overall response rates (i.e., Complete plus Good Partial plus Partial Responses) were 89% and 86% in Study A and Study B, respectively, for a combined overall response rate of 88% in evaluable patients treated with cladribine injection. Using an intent-to-treat analysis (N=123) and further requiring no evidence of splenomegaly as a criterion for CR (i.e., no palpable spleen on physical examination and \u2264 13 cm on CT scan), the complete response rates for Study A and Study B were 54% and 53%, respectively, giving a combined CR rate of 54%. The overall response rates (CR + GPR + PR) were 90% and 85%, for Studies A and B, respectively, yielding a combined overall response rate of 89%. RESPONSE RATES TO CLADRIBINE INJECTION TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA CR Overall Evaluable Patients N=106 66% 88% Intent-to-treat Population N=123 54% 89% In these studies, 60% of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy for Hairy Cell Leukemia or had undergone splenectomy as the only prior treatment and were receiving cladribine injection as a first-line treatment. The remaining 40% of the patients received cladribine injection as a second-line treatment, having been treated previously with other agents, including \u03b1-interferon and/or deoxycoformycin. The overall response rate for patients without prior chemotherapy was 92%, compared with 84% for previously treated patients. Cladribine injection is active in previously treated patients; however, retrospective analysis suggests that the overall response rate is decreased in patients previously treated with splenectomy or deoxycoformycin and in patients refractory to \u03b1-interferon.

The median time to normalization of peripheral counts was nine weeks from the start of treatment (Range: 2 to 72). The median time to normalization of Platelet Count was two weeks, the median time to normalization of ANC was five weeks and the median time to normalization of Hemoglobin was eight weeks. With normalization of Platelet Count and Hemoglobin, requirements for platelet and RBC transfusions were abolished after Months 1 and 2, respectively, in those patients with complete response. Platelet recovery may be delayed in a minority of patients with severe baseline thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to normalization of ANC, a trend toward a reduced incidence of infection was seen after the third month, when compared to the months immediately preceding cladribine injection therapy (see also WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). CLADRIBINE INJECTION TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA TIME TO NORMALIZATION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNTS Parameter Median Time to Normalization of Count* Platelet Count 2 weeks Absolute Neutrophil Count 5 weeks Hemoglobin 8 weeks ANC, Hemoglobin and Platelet Count 9 weeks *Day 1 = First day of infusion For patients achieving a complete response, the median time to response (i.e., absence of hairy cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood together with normalization of peripheral blood parameters), measured from treatment start, was approximately four months. Since bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were frequently not performed at the time of peripheral blood normalization, the median time to complete response may actually be shorter than that which was recorded. At the time of data cut-off, the median duration of complete response was greater than eight months and ranged to 25+ months. Among 93 responding patients, seven had shown evidence of disease progression at the time of the data cut-off. In four of these patients, disease was limited to the bone marrow without peripheral blood abnormalities (pathologic progression), while in three patients there were also peripheral blood abnormalities (clinical progression). Seven patients who did not respond to a first course of cladribine injection received a second course of therapy. In the five patients who had adequate follow-up, additional courses did not appear to improve their overall response."

      "WARNINGS: Due to increased risk of infection in the setting of immunosuppression with chemotherapy including cladribine, it is recommended not to administer live attenuated vaccines to patients receiving cladribine injection. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been commonly observed in patients treated with cladribine injection, especially at high doses. At initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had hematologic impairment as a manifestation of active Hairy Cell Leukemia. Following treatment with cladribine injection, further hematologic impairment occurred before recovery of peripheral blood counts began. During the first two weeks after treatment initiation, mean Platelet Count, ANC, and Hemoglobin concentration declined and subsequently increased with normalization of mean counts by Day 12, Week 5 and Week 8, respectively. The myelosuppressive effects of cladribine injection were most notable during the first month following treatment. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients received transfusions with RBCs and 14% received transfusions with platelets during Month 1. Careful hematologic monitoring, especially during the first four to eight weeks after treatment with cladribine injection, is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fever (T \u2265 100\u00b0F) was associated with the use of cladribine injection in approximately two-thirds of patients (131/196) in the first month of therapy. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with parenteral antibiotics. Overall, 47% (93/196) of all patients had fever in the setting of neutropenia (ANC \u2264 1,000), including 62 patients (32%) with severe neutropenia (i.e., ANC \u2264 500). In a Phase I investigational study using cladribine injection in high doses (four to nine times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) as part of a bone marrow transplant conditioning regimen, which also included high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, acute nephrotoxicity and delayed onset neurotoxicity were observed. Thirty-one (31) poor-risk patients with drug-resistant acute leukemia in relapse (29 cases) or non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (two cases) received cladribine for 7 to 14 days prior to bone marrow transplantation. During infusion, eight patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. While the bone marrow was initially cleared of all hematopoietic elements, including tumor cells, leukemia eventually recurred in all treated patients. Within 7 to 13 days after starting treatment with cladribine, six patients (19%) developed manifestations of renal dysfunction (e.g., acidosis, anuria, elevated serum creatinine, etc.) and five required dialysis. Several of these patients were also being treated with other medications having known nephrotoxic potential. Renal dysfunction was reversible in two of these patients. In the four patients whose renal function had not recovered at the time of death, autopsies were performed; in two of these, evidence of tubular damage was noted. Eleven (11) patients (35%) experienced delayed onset neurologic toxicity. In the majority, this was characterized by progressive irreversible motor weakness (paraparesis/quadriparesis), of the upper and/or lower extremities, first noted 35 to 84 days after starting high dose therapy with cladribine. Non-invasive testing (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) was consistent with demyelinating disease. Severe neurologic toxicity has also been noted with high doses of another drug in this class. Axonal peripheral polyneuropathy was observed in a dose escalation study at the highest dose levels (approximately four times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) in patients not receiving cyclophosphamide or total body irradiation. Severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. In patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia treated with the recommended treatment regimen (0.09 mg/kg/day for seven consecutive days), there have been no reports of nephrologic toxicities. Serious (e.g. respiratory infection, pneumonia and viral skin infections), including fatal infections (e.g., sepsis) were reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Of the 196 Hairy Cell Leukemia patients entered in the two trials, there were eight deaths following treatment. Of these, six were of infectious etiology, including three pneumonias, and two occurred in the first month following cladribine therapy. Of the eight deaths, six occurred in previously treated patients who were refractory to \u03b1-interferon. Benzyl alcohol is a constituent of the recommended diluent for the seven-day infusion solution. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \u201cGasping Syndrome\u201d in premature infants (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pregnancy Category D Cladribine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Although there is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans due to cladribine, other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis have been reported to be teratogenic in humans. Cladribine is teratogenic in animals. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with cladribine. If cladribine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Cladribine is teratogenic in mice and rabbits and consequently has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. A significant increase in fetal variations was observed in mice receiving 1.5 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m 2 ) and increased resorptions, reduced litter size and increased fetal malformations were observed when mice received 3 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m 2 ). Fetal death and malformations were observed in rabbits that received 3 mg/kg/day (33 mg/m 2 ). No fetal effects were seen in mice at 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/m 2 ) or in rabbits at 1 mg/kg/day (11 mg/m 2 ).",

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first four to eight weeks posttreatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Development of acute renal insufficiency in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described. Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic insufficiency (see WARNINGS ). Rare cases of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden. Cladribine injection must be diluted in designated intravenous solutions prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Laboratory Tests During and following treatment, the patient\u2019s hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 x 10 9 /L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1,500 x 10 6 /L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8. After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine. Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies. Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated. Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with cladribine injection. Caution should be exercised if cladribine injection is administered before, after, or in conjunction with other drugs known to cause immunosuppression or myelosuppression (see WARNINGS ). Carcinogenesis No animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cladribine. However, its carcinogenic potential cannot be excluded based on demonstrated genotoxicity of cladribine. Mutagenesis As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage. In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cladribine was not mutagenic in vitro (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. However, cladribine was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility The effect on human fertility is unknown. When administered intravenously to Cynomolgus monkeys, cladribine has been shown to cause suppression of rapidly generating cells, including testicular cells. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine injection was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for five days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), three of seven patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study (1) (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients.",
      "General Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first four to eight weeks posttreatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated.

In Month 1 of the Hairy Cell Leukemia clinical trials, severe neutropenia was noted in 70% of patients, fever in 69%, and infection was documented in 28%. Most non-hematologic adverse experiences were mild to moderate in severity. Myelosuppression was frequently observed during the first month after starting treatment. Neutropenia (ANC < 500 x 10 6 /L) was noted in 70% of patients, compared with 26% in whom it was present initially. Severe anemia (Hemoglobin < 8.5 g/dL) developed in 37% of patients, compared with 10% initially and thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 20 x 10 9 /L) developed in 12% of patients, compared to 4% in whom it was noted initially. During the first month, 54 of 196 patients (28%) exhibited documented evidence of infection. Serious infections (e.g., septicemia, pneumonia) were reported in 6% of all patients; the remainder were mild or moderate. Several deaths were attributable to infection and/or complications related to the underlying disease. During the second month, the overall rate of documented infection was 6%; these infections were mild to moderate and no severe systemic infections were seen. After the third month, the monthly incidence of infection was either less than or equal to that of the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. During the first month, 11% of patients experienced severe fever (i.e., \u2265 104\u00b0F). Documented infections were noted in fewer than one-third of febrile episodes. Of the 196 patients studied, 19 were noted to have a documented infection in the month prior to treatment. In the month following treatment, there were 54 episodes of documented infection: 23 (42%) were bacterial, 11 (20%) were viral and 11 (20%) were fungal. Seven (7) of 8 documented episodes of herpes zoster occurred during the month following treatment. Fourteen (14) of 16 episodes of documented fungal infections occurred in the first two months following treatment. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with antibiotics (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Analysis of lymphocyte subsets indicates that treatment with cladribine is associated with prolonged depression of the CD4 counts. Prior to treatment, the mean CD4 count was 766/ \u03bc L. The mean CD4 count nadir, which occurred four to six months following treatment, was 272/ \u03bc L. Fifteen (15) months after treatment, mean CD4 counts remained below 500/ \u03bc L. CD8 counts behaved similarly, though increasing counts were observed after nine months. The clinical significance of the prolonged CD4 lymphopenia is unclear. Another event of unknown clinical significance includes the observation of prolonged bone marrow hypocellularity. Bone marrow cellularity of < 35% was noted after four months in 42 of 124 patients (34%) treated in the two pivotal trials. This hypocellularity was noted as late as Day 1,010. It is not known whether the hypocellularity is the result of disease related marrow fibrosis or if it is the result of cladribine toxicity. There was no apparent clinical effect on the peripheral blood counts. The vast majority of rashes were mild. Most episodes of nausea were mild, not accompanied by vomiting, and did not require treatment with antiemetics. In patients requiring antiemetics, nausea was easily controlled, most frequently with chlorpromazine. When used in other clinical settings the following ADRs were reported: bacteremia, cellulitis, localized infection, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (with bleeding or petechiae), phlebitis, purpura, crepitations, localized edema and edema. For a description of adverse reactions associated with use of high doses in non-Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, see WARNINGS . Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported since the drug became commercially available. These adverse reactions have been reported primarily in patients who received multiple courses of cladribine injection: Infections and infestations: Septic shock. Opportunistic infections have occurred in the acute phase of treatment. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Bone marrow suppression with prolonged pancytopenia, including some reports of aplastic anemia; hemolytic anemia (including autoimmune hemolytic anemia), which was reported in patients with lymphoid malignancies, occurring within the first few weeks following treatment. Rare cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Tumor lysis syndrome. Psychiatric disorders: Confusion (including disorientation). Hepatobiliary disorders: Reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases. Nervous System disorders: Depressed level of consciousness, neurological toxicity (including peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy (paralysis), polyneuropathy, paraparesis); however, severe neurotoxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Eye disorders: Conjunctivitis. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (including lung infiltration, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis); in most cases, an infectious etiology was identified. Skin and tissue disorders: Urticaria, hypereosinophilia; Stevens-Johnson. In isolated cases toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with other medications (e.g., allopurinol or antibiotics) known to cause these syndromes. Renal and urinary disorders: Renal failure (including renal failure acute, renal impairment).",

      "OVERDOSAGE: High doses of cladribine have been associated with: irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), acute nephrotoxicity, and severe bone marrow suppression resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS ). There is no known specific antidote to overdosage. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of cladribine, careful observation, and appropriate supportive measures. It is not known whether the drug can be removed from the circulation by dialysis or hemofiltration."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Usual Dosage The recommended dose and schedule of cladribine injection for active Hairy Cell Leukemia is as a single course given by continuous infusion for seven consecutive days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. Deviations from this dosage regimen are not advised. If the patient does not respond to the initial course of cladribine injection for Hairy Cell Leukemia, it is unlikely that they will benefit from additional courses. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity or renal toxicity occurs (see WARNINGS ). Specific risk factors predisposing to increased toxicity from cladribine injection have not been defined. In view of the known toxicities of agents of this class, it would be prudent to proceed carefully in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency or severe bone marrow impairment of any etiology. Patients should be monitored closely for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solutions Cladribine injection must be diluted with the designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of cladribine injection solutions . To prepare a single daily dose Cladribine injection should be passed through a sterile 0.22 \u03bc m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag, prior to each daily infusion. Add the calculated dose (0.09 mg/kg or 0.09 mL/kg) of cladribine injection through the sterile filter to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Infuse continuously over 24 hours. Repeat daily for a total of seven consecutive days. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended because of increased degradation of cladribine. Admixtures of cladribine injection are chemically and physically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal room fluorescent light in Baxter Viaflex \u00ae PVC infusion containers. Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Dose of Cladribine Injection Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 24-hour infusion method 1 (day) x 0.09 mg/kg 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 500 mL To prepare a 7-day infusion The seven-day infusion solution should only be prepared with Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved). In order to minimize the risk of microbial contamination, both cladribine injection and the diluent should be passed through a sterile 0.22 \u03bc m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter as each solution is being introduced into the infusion reservoir. First add the calculated dose of cladribine injection (7 days x 0.09 mg/kg or mL/kg) to the infusion reservoir through the sterile filter. Then add a calculated amount of Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved) also through the filter to bring the total volume of the solution to 100 mL. After completing solution preparation, clamp off the line, disconnect and discard the filter. Aseptically aspirate air bubbles from the reservoir as necessary using the syringe and a dry second sterile filter or a sterile vent filter assembly. Reclamp the line and discard the syringe and filter assembly. Infuse continuously over seven days. Solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection for individuals weighing more than 85 kg may have reduced preservative effectiveness due to greater dilution of the benzyl alcohol preservative. Admixtures for the seven-day infusion have demonstrated acceptable chemical and physical stability for at least seven days in the SIMS Deltec MEDICATION CASSETTE\u2122 Reservoir. Dose of Cladribine Injection Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 7-day infusion method (use sterile 0.22 \u03bc m filter when preparing infusion solution 7 (days) x 0.09 mg/kg Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol) q.s. to 100 mL Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Solutions containing cladribine injection should not be mixed with other intravenous drugs or additives or infused simultaneously via a common intravenous line, since compatibility testing has not been performed. Preparations containing benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates (see WARNINGS ). Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Once diluted, solutions of cladribine injection should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for no more than eight hours prior to start of administration. Vials of cladribine injection are for single-use only. Any unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner (see Handling and Disposal ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A precipitate may occur during the exposure of cladribine injection to low temperatures; it may be resolubilized by allowing the solution to warm naturally to room temperature and by shaking vigorously. DO NOT HEAT OR MICROWAVE. Chemical Stability of Vials When stored in refrigerated conditions between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) and protected from light, unopened vials of cladribine injection are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package. Freezing does not adversely affect the solution. If freezing occurs, thaw naturally to room temperature. DO NOT heat or microwave. Once thawed, the vial of cladribine injection is stable until expiry if refrigerated. DO NOT refreeze. Once diluted, solutions containing cladribine injection should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for no more than 8 hours prior to administration. Handling and Disposal The potential hazards associated with cytotoxic agents are well established and proper precautions should be taken when handling, preparing, and administering cladribine injection. The use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended. If cladribine injection contacts the skin or mucous membranes, wash the involved surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.

(2.1) Cumulative dosage of 3.5 mg/kg administered orally and divided into 2 treatment courses (1.75 mg/kg per treatment course). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles. (2.2) Cladribine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. (2.4) Separate administration from any other oral drug by at least 3 hours. (2.4) 2.1 Assessments Prior to Starting Each Cladribine Treatment Course Cancer Screening Follow standard cancer screening guidelines because of the risk of malignancies [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Pregnancy Exclude pregnancy prior to treatment with cladribine tablets in females of reproductive potential [ see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Lymphocytes must be: within normal limits before initiating the first treatment course at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment course If necessary, delay the second treatment course for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of lymphocytes to at least 800 cells per microliter. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive further treatment with cladribine tablets. Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Exclude HIV infection. Perform tuberculosis screening. Screen for hepatitis B and C. Evaluate for acute infection. Consider a delay in cladribine treatment until any acute infection is fully controlled. Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for VZV is recommended prior to initiation of cladribine tablets. Vaccination of patients who are seropositive to VZV is recommended with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted. Patients may be administered zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted at any time prior to or during the year 1 or year 2 course of cladribine treatment. These patients may also be administered the vaccine if their lymphocyte counts are \u2264 500 cells per microliter. Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Liver Injury Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended cumulative dosage of cladribine tablets is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles: Administration of First Treatment Course First Course/First Cycle: start any time. First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle. Administration of Second Treatment Course Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle. Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily. Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional cladribine treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating cladribine tablets more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied. 2.3 Missed Dose If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses. If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days. 2.4 Administration Cladribine tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. Cladribine tablets can be taken with or without food. Separate administration of cladribine tablets and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day cladribine treatment cycles [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ]. Cladribine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [ see References (15) ]. Cladribine tablets are an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water. The patient\u2019s hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin. 2.5 Laboratory Testing and Monitoring to Assess Safety Cancer Screening Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with cladribine tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Complete Blood Count Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count: before initiating the first treatment course of cladribine tablets before initiating the second treatment course of cladribine tablets 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment course; if the lymphocyte count at month 2 is below 200 cells per microliter, monitor monthly until month 6. See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3, 5.4 ) for instructions based on the patient\u2019s lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections). Hold cladribine tablets therapy if the lymphocyte count is below 200 cells per microliter periodically thereafter and when clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] 2.6 Recommended Concomitant Medication Herpes Prophylaxis Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lymphopenia: Monitor lymphocyte counts before, during and after treatment. (5.3) Infections: Serious, including life-threatening and fatal infections, have occurred. Screen patients for active and latent infections; delay treatment until infection is fully resolved or controlled. Vaccination of patients seronegative to varicella zoster virus (VZV) is recommended prior to treatment. Vaccination of patients seropositive to VZV with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted, is recommended prior to or during treatment. Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter. Monitor for infections. (5.4) Hematologic toxicity: Monitor complete blood count before, during and after treatment. (5.5) Graft-versus-host-disease with blood transfusion: Irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended. (5.6) Liver injury: Clinically significant liver injury has occurred. Obtain tests prior to treatment. Discontinue if clinically significant injury is suspected. (5.7) 5.1 Malignancies Treatment with cladribine tablets may increase the risk of malignancy. In controlled and extension clinical studies worldwide, malignancies occurred more frequently in cladribine-treated patients [10 events in 3,754 patient-years (0.27 events per 100 patient-years)], compared to placebo patients [3 events in 2,275 patient-years (0.13 events per 100 patient-years)]. Malignancy cases in cladribine patients included metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma (2 cases), ovarian cancer, compared to malignancy cases in placebo patients, all of which were curable by surgical resection [basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ (2 cases)]. The incidence of malignancies in United States cladribine clinical study patients was higher than the rest of the world [4 events in 189 patient-years (2.21 events per 100 patient-years) compared to 0 events in United States placebo patients]; however, the United States results were based on a limited amount of patient data. After the completion of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional cladribine treatment during the next 2 years [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. In clinical studies, patients who received additional cladribine treatment within 2 years after the first 2 treatment courses had an increased incidence of malignancy [7 events in 790 patient-years (0.91 events per 100 patient-years) calculated from the start of cladribine treatment in Year 3]. The risk of malignancy with reinitiating cladribine tablets more than 2 years after the completion of 2 treatment courses has not been studied. Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of cladribine tablets on an individual patient basis. Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with cladribine tablets. 5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity Cladribine tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during cladribine tablets dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of cladribine tablets and prevented by the use of effective contraception during cladribine tablets dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with cladribine tablets should discontinue treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . Cladribine tablets are contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. 5.3 Lymphopenia Cladribine tablets cause a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of cladribine-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of cladribine tablets 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks. Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if cladribine tablets are administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%). Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with cladribine tablets. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient\u2019s lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections). 5.4 Infections Serious, including life-threatening or fatal, bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections have been reported in patients receiving cladribine tablets. Cladribine tablets reduces the body's immune defense, and an increased risk of infections has been observed in patients receiving cladribine tablets. Infections occurred in 49% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 44% of placebo patients in clinical studies; serious or severe infections occurred in 2.4% of cladribine-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent serious infections in cladribine-treated patients included herpes zoster and pyelonephritis ( see Herpes Virus Infections ). Fungal infections were observed, including cases of coccidioidomycosis. In the postmarketing setting, serious infections have been reported, including nocardiosis, varicella zoster, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. The majority of patients with these infections who had an available absolute lymphocyte count at the time of the event had concurrent lymphopenia, consistent with the mechanism of action of cladribine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. HIV infection, active tuberculosis, and active hepatitis must be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of cladribine tablets [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Delay initiation of cladribine tablets in patients with an acute infection until the infection is fully resolved or controlled. Initiation of cladribine tablets in patients currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Concomitant use of cladribine tablets with these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. Tuberculosis Three of 1,976 (0.2%) cladribine-treated patients in the clinical program developed tuberculosis. All three cases occurred in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. One case of tuberculosis was fatal, and two cases resolved with treatment. Perform tuberculosis screening prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of cladribine tablets. Latent tuberculosis infections may be activated with use of cladribine tablets. In patients with tuberculosis infection, delay initiation of cladribine tablets until the infection has been adequately treated. Hepatitis One clinical study patient died from fulminant hepatitis B infection. Perform screening for hepatitis B and C prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of cladribine tablets. Latent hepatitis infections may be activated with use of cladribine tablets. Patients who are carriers of hepatitis B or C virus may be at risk of irreversible liver damage caused by virus reactivation. In patients with hepatitis infection, delay initiation of cladribine tablets until the infection has been adequately treated. Herpes Virus Infections In controlled clinical studies, 6% of cladribine-treated patients developed a herpes viral infection compared to 2% of placebo patients. The most frequent types of herpes viral infections were herpes zoster infections (2.0% vs. 0.2%) and oral herpes (2.6% vs. 1.2%). Serious herpes zoster infections occurred in 0.2% of cladribine-treated patients. Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for varicella zoster virus is recommended prior to initiation of cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets. Vaccination with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted is recommended for patients who are seropositive to VZV, either prior to or during cladribine treatment, including when their lymphocyte counts are less than or equal to 500 cells per microliter. The incidence of herpes zoster was higher during the period of absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells per microliter, compared to the time when the patients were not experiencing this degree of lymphopenia. Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter. Patients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells per microliter should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of infections, including herpes infections. If such signs and symptoms occur, initiate treatment as clinically indicated. Consider interruption or delay of cladribine tablets until resolution of the infection. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. No case of PML has been reported in clinical studies of cladribine in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients treated with parenteral cladribine for oncologic indications, cases of PML have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initiating the first treatment course of cladribine tablets. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold cladribine tablets and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccinations Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting cladribine tablets. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine tablets, because of a risk of active vaccine infection (see Herpes Virus Infections) . Avoid vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines during and after cladribine treatment while the patient\u2019s white blood cell counts are not within normal limits. 5.5 Hematologic Toxicity In addition to lymphopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] , decreases in other blood cells and hematological parameters have been reported with cladribine in clinical studies. Mild to moderate decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count between 1,000 cells per microliter and < lower limit of normal (LLN)) were observed in 27% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 13% of placebo patients whereas severe decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count below 1,000 cells per microliter) were observed in 3.6% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 2.8% of placebo patients. Decreases in hemoglobin levels, in general mild to moderate (hemoglobin 8 g per dL to < LLN), were observed in 26% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 19% of placebo patients. Decreases in platelet counts were generally mild (cell count 75,000 cells per microliter to < LLN) and were observed in 11% of cladribine- treated patients, compared to 4% of placebo patients. In clinical studies at dosages similar to or higher than the approved cladribine dosage, serious cases of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia (some with documented bone marrow hypoplasia) requiring transfusion and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) for information regarding graft-versus- host disease with blood transfusion ]. Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential prior to, during, and after treatment with cladribine tablets [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) ]. 5.6 Risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Blood Transfusion Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed rarely after transfusion of nonirradiated blood in patients treated with cladribine for non-MS treatment indications. In patients who require blood transfusion, irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended prior to administration to decrease the risk of transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease. Consultation with a hematologist is advised. 5.7 Liver Injury Cladribine tablets can cause liver injury. In clinical studies, 0.3% of cladribine-treated patients had liver injury (serious or causing treatment discontinuation) considered related to treatment, compared to 0 placebo patients. Onset ranged from a few weeks to several months after initiation of treatment with cladribine. Signs and symptoms of liver injury, including elevation of serum aminotransferases to greater than 20-fold the upper limit of normal, were observed. These abnormalities resolved upon treatment discontinuation. Clinically significant and life-threatening liver injury has been reported in patients treated with cladribine tablets in the postmarketing setting. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and patients taking other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for developing liver injury when taking cladribine tablets. Most reported cases of liver injury associated with cladribine tablets occurred approximately 30 days after initiation (i.e., course 1, cycle 1) of treatment. Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 6) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. If a patient develops clinical signs, including unexplained liver enzyme elevations, or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with cladribine tablets, as appropriate. 5.8 Hypersensitivity In clinical studies, 11% of cladribine-treated patients had hypersensitivity reactions, compared to 7% of placebo patients. Hypersensitivity reactions that were serious and/or led to discontinuation of cladribine tablets (e.g., dermatitis, pruritis) occurred in 0.5% of cladribine-treated patients, compared to 0.1% of placebo patients. One patient had a serious hypersensitivity reaction with rash, mucous membrane ulceration, throat swelling, vertigo, diplopia, and headache after the first dose of cladribine tablets. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue cladribine therapy. Do not use cladribine tablets in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cladribine [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Cardiac Failure In clinical studies, one cladribine-treated patient experienced life-threatening acute cardiac failure with myocarditis, which improved after approximately one week. Cases of cardiac failure have also been reported with parenteral cladribine used for treatment indications other than multiple sclerosis. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if they experience symptoms of cardiac failure (e.g., shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, swelling)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions and potential risks are discussed, or discussed in greater detail, in other sections of the labeling: Malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Risk of Teratogenicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Lymphopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hematologic Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Blood Transfusion [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Cardiac Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 20%) are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the clinical trial program of cladribine in MS, 1,976 patients received cladribine for a total of 9,509 patient years. The mean time on study including follow-up was approximately 4.8 years, and approximately 24% of cladribine-treated patients had approximately 8 years of time on study including follow-up. Of these, 923 patients aged 18 to 66 years received cladribine as monotherapy at a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg per kg. Table 2 shows adverse reactions in Study 1 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] with an incidence of at least 5% for cladribine and higher than placebo. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions reported in Study 1 are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia.

Alopecia Alopecia occurred in 3% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo patients. Myelodysplastic Syndrome Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in patients that had received parenteral cladribine at a higher dosage than that approved for cladribine. These cases occurred several years after treatment. Herpes Meningoencephalitis Fatal herpes meningoencephalitis occurred in one cladribine-treated patient, at a higher dosage and longer duration of therapy than the approved cladribine dosage and in combination with interferon beta-1a treatment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) SJS and TEN are identified risks of parenteral cladribine for the treatment of oncologic indications. Seizures In clinical studies, serious events of seizure occurred in 0.3% of cladribine-treated patients compared to 0 placebo patients. Serious events included generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus. It is unknown whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to cladribine, or to a combination of both. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of cladribine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: nocardiosis, varicella zoster, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Hepatobiliary Disorders: liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3 Drug Interactions with cladribine tablets 7.1 Immunomodulatory, Immunosuppressive, or Myelosuppressive Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or myelosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive effects on the immune system [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Prevention or Management Concomitant use with myelosuppressive or other immunosuppressive drugs is not recommended. Acute short-term therapy with corticosteroids can be administered. In patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, consider potential additive effect, the mode of action, and duration of effect of the other drugs prior to initiation of cladribine. 7.2 Interferon-Beta Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with interferon-beta did not change the exposure of cladribine to a clinically significant effect; however, lymphopenia risk may be increased [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Prevention or Management Concomitant use is not recommended. 7.3 Hematotoxic Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of cladribine with hematotoxic drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive hematological effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Prevention or Management Monitor hematological parameters. 7.4 Antiviral and Antiretroviral Drugs Clinical Impact Compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine) could interfere with the intracellular phosphorylation and activity of cladribine. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use. 7.5 Potent ENT, CNT and BCRP Transporter Inhibitors Clinical Impact Cladribine is a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside (ENT1), and concentrative nucleoside (CNT3) transport proteins. The bioavailability, intracellular distribution, and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3, and BCRP transporter inhibitors. Prevention or Management Avoid co-administration of potent ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, eltrombopag, curcumin, cyclosporine, dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, cilostazol, sulindac, dipyridamole, or reserpine) during the 4 to 5 day cladribine treatment cycles. If this is not possible, consider selection of alternative concomitant drugs with no or minimal ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibiting properties. If this is not possible, dose reduction to the minimum mandatory dose of drugs containing these compounds, separation in the timing of administration, and careful patient monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Potent BCRP and P-gp Transporter Inducers Clinical Impact Possible decrease in cladribine exposure if potent BCRP or P-gp transporter inducers are co-administered. Prevention or Management Consider a possible decrease in cladribine efficacy if potent BCRP (e.g., corticosteroids) or P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's Wort) transporter inducers are co-administered. Immunosuppressive drugs: Consider overlapping effects on immune system, when used sequentially. Concomitant use not recommended. (7.1) Hematotoxic drugs: Monitor patients for additive effects on the hematological profile. (7.3) Antiviral and antiretroviral drugs: Avoid concomitant use. (7.4) BCRP or ENT/CNT inhibitors: May alter bioavailability of cladribine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.5)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women and in females and males of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of cladribine in pregnant women. Cladribine was embryolethal when administered to pregnant mice and produced malformations in mice and rabbits [ see Data ]. The observed developmental effects are consistent with the effects of cladribine on DNA [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and malformations (including exencephaly and cleft palate) and embryofetal death were observed at the highest dose tested. An increase in skeletal variations was observed at all but the lowest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and a high incidence of craniofacial and limb malformations were observed at the highest dose tested, in the absence of maternal toxicity. When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day) to mice throughout pregnancy and lactation, skeletal anomalies and embryolethality were observed at all but the lowest dose tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Cladribine tablets are contraindicated in breastfeeding women because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Advise women not to breastfeed during dosing with cladribine and for 10 days after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of cladribine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before the initiation of each treatment course of cladribine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential should prevent pregnancy by use of effective contraception during cladribine dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during cladribine tablets therapy should discontinue treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Males As cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on human gametogenesis could be expected. Therefore, male patients of reproductive potential should take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their partner during cladribine dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients (below 18 years of age) have not been established. Use of cladribine is not recommended in pediatric patients because of the risk of malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Caution is recommended when cladribine is used in elderly patients, taking into account the potential greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, concomitant diseases, and other drug therapy. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment The concentration of cladribine is predicted to increase in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to 89 mL per minute). Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 60 mL per minute) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Cladribine tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 6) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Particularly close monitoring of hematological parameters is recommended in patients who have been exposed to an overdose of cladribine tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5) ]. There is no known specific antidote to an overdose of cladribine tablets. Treatment consists of careful observation and initiation of appropriate supportive measures. Discontinuation of cladribine tablets may need to be considered. Because of the rapid and extensive intracellular and tissue distribution, hemodialysis is unlikely to eliminate cladribine to a significant extent."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Cladribine tablets contains the nucleoside metabolic inhibitor cladribine, which is a white to off-white crystalline powder with the molecular formula C 10 H 12 ClN 5 O 3 and molecular weight 285.69 g/mol. It differs in structure from the naturally occurring nucleoside, deoxyadenosine, by the substitution of chlorine for hydrogen in the 2-position of the purine ring. The chemical name of cladribine is 2-chloro-2\u2032-deoxy-adenosine. The structural formula is shown below: Cladribine is stable at slightly basic and at neutral pH. The main degradation pathway is hydrolysis and at acidic pH significant decomposition occurs with time. The ionization behavior of the molecule over the pH range 0 to 12 is characterized by a single pKa of approximately 1.21. Cladribine tablets are provided as 10 mg tablet for oral use. Each 10 mg tablet contains cladribine as an active ingredient and magnesium stearate and sorbitol as inactive ingredients. Cladribine tablets also contain hydroxypropyl betadex."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been fully elucidated but is thought to involve cytotoxic effects on B and T lymphocytes through impairment of DNA synthesis, resulting in depletion of lymphocytes. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cladribine tablets causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment cycle and were lower with each additional treatment cycle. At the end of Year 2, 2% of patients continued to have absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter. The median time to recovery from lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Cladribine is a prodrug that becomes active upon phosphorylation to its 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd-ATP) metabolite. The pharmacokinetic parameters presented below were assessed following oral administration of cladribine 10 mg, unless otherwise specified. The cladribine mean maximum concentration (C max ) was in the range of 22 to 29 ng/ mL and corresponding mean AUC was in the range of 80 to 101 ng\u00b7h/mL. The C max and AUC of cladribine increased proportionally across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg. No accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma was observed after repeated dosing. Absorption The bioavailability of cladribine was approximately 40%. Following fasted administration of cladribine, the median time to maximum concentration (T max ) was 0.5 h (range 0.5 to 1.5 hours). Effect of Food Following administration of cladribine with a high fat meal, the geometric mean C max decreased by 29% and AUC was unchanged. The T max was prolonged to 1.5 hours (range 1 to 3 hours). This difference is not expected to be clinically significant. Distribution Cladribine mean apparent volume of distribution ranges from 480 to 490 liters. The plasma protein binding of cladribine is 20% and is independent of concentration, in vitro . Intracellular concentrations of cladribine and/or its metabolites in human lymphocytes were approximately 30 to 40 times extracellular, in vitro . Cladribine has the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A cerebrospinal fluid/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.25 was observed in cancer patients. Elimination Cladribine estimated terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. The intracellular half-life of the cladribine phosphorylated metabolites cladribine monophosphate (Cd-AMP) is 15 hours and Cd- ATP is 10 hours. Cladribine estimated median apparent renal clearance is 22.2 liter per hour and non-renal clearance is 23.4 liter per hour. Metabolism Cladribine is a prodrug that is phosphorylated to Cd-AMP by deoxycytidine kinase (and also by deoxyguanosine kinase in the mitochondria) in lymphocytes. Cd-AMP is further phosphorylated to cladribine diphosphate (Cd-ADP) and the active moiety Cd-ATP. The dephosphorylation and deactivation of Cd-AMP is catalyzed by cytoplasmic 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-Ntase). The metabolism of cladribine in whole blood has not been fully characterized. However, extensive whole blood and negligible hepatic enzyme metabolism was observed, in vitro. Excretion After administration of 10 mg oral cladribine in MS patients, 28.5 [20] (mean [SD]) percent of the dose was excreted unchanged via the renal route. Renal clearance exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating active renal secretion of cladribine. Specific Populations No studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cladribine in elderly or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cladribine based on age (range 18 to 65 years) or gender. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine is unknown. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal clearance of cladribine was shown to be dependent on creatinine clearance (CL CR ). No dedicated studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment, however patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR of 60 mL to below 90 mL per minute) were included in Study 1. A pooled pharmacokinetic analysis estimated a decrease of 18% in total clearance in a typical subject with a CL CR of 65 mL per minute leading to an increase in cladribine exposure of 25%. Clinical experience in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e., CL CR below 60 mL per minute) is limited [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in cladribine pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with pantoprazole or interferon beta-1a. No clinically significant differences in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics were observed when a combined oral hormonal contraceptive (containing 150 mcg levonorgestrel and 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) was used concomitantly with cladribine. In Vitro Studies It has been reported that lamivudine can inhibit the phosphorylation of cladribine intracellularly. Potential competition for intracellular phosphorylation exists between cladribine and compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Cladribine is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes and does not show significant potential to act as inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Cladribine has no clinically meaningful inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Cladribine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3). Inhibition of BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract may increase the oral bioavailability and systemic exposure of cladribine. Intracellular distribution and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3 transporter inhibitors. 12.6 Hydroxypropyl Betadex-Related Complex Formation Cladribine tablets contain hydroxypropyl betadex that may be available for complex formation with the active ingredients of other drugs. Complex formation between free hydroxypropyl betadex, released from the cladribine tablet formulation, and concomitant ibuprofen, furosemide, and gabapentin was observed. Concomitant use with cladribine tablets may increase the bioavailability of other drugs (especially agents with low solubility), which may increase the risk or severity of adverse reactions [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cladribine tablets causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment cycle and were lower with each additional treatment cycle. At the end of Year 2, 2% of patients continued to have absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter. The median time to recovery from lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Cladribine is a prodrug that becomes active upon phosphorylation to its 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd-ATP) metabolite. The pharmacokinetic parameters presented below were assessed following oral administration of cladribine 10 mg, unless otherwise specified. The cladribine mean maximum concentration (C max ) was in the range of 22 to 29 ng/ mL and corresponding mean AUC was in the range of 80 to 101 ng\u00b7h/mL. The C max and AUC of cladribine increased proportionally across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg. No accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma was observed after repeated dosing. Absorption The bioavailability of cladribine was approximately 40%. Following fasted administration of cladribine, the median time to maximum concentration (T max ) was 0.5 h (range 0.5 to 1.5 hours). Effect of Food Following administration of cladribine with a high fat meal, the geometric mean C max decreased by 29% and AUC was unchanged. The T max was prolonged to 1.5 hours (range 1 to 3 hours). This difference is not expected to be clinically significant. Distribution Cladribine mean apparent volume of distribution ranges from 480 to 490 liters. The plasma protein binding of cladribine is 20% and is independent of concentration, in vitro . Intracellular concentrations of cladribine and/or its metabolites in human lymphocytes were approximately 30 to 40 times extracellular, in vitro . Cladribine has the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A cerebrospinal fluid/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.25 was observed in cancer patients. Elimination Cladribine estimated terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. The intracellular half-life of the cladribine phosphorylated metabolites cladribine monophosphate (Cd-AMP) is 15 hours and Cd- ATP is 10 hours. Cladribine estimated median apparent renal clearance is 22.2 liter per hour and non-renal clearance is 23.4 liter per hour. Metabolism Cladribine is a prodrug that is phosphorylated to Cd-AMP by deoxycytidine kinase (and also by deoxyguanosine kinase in the mitochondria) in lymphocytes. Cd-AMP is further phosphorylated to cladribine diphosphate (Cd-ADP) and the active moiety Cd-ATP. The dephosphorylation and deactivation of Cd-AMP is catalyzed by cytoplasmic 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-Ntase). The metabolism of cladribine in whole blood has not been fully characterized. However, extensive whole blood and negligible hepatic enzyme metabolism was observed, in vitro. Excretion After administration of 10 mg oral cladribine in MS patients, 28.5 [20] (mean [SD]) percent of the dose was excreted unchanged via the renal route. Renal clearance exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating active renal secretion of cladribine. Specific Populations No studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cladribine in elderly or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cladribine based on age (range 18 to 65 years) or gender. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine is unknown. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal clearance of cladribine was shown to be dependent on creatinine clearance (CL CR ). No dedicated studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment, however patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR of 60 mL to below 90 mL per minute) were included in Study 1. A pooled pharmacokinetic analysis estimated a decrease of 18% in total clearance in a typical subject with a CL CR of 65 mL per minute leading to an increase in cladribine exposure of 25%. Clinical experience in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e., CL CR below 60 mL per minute) is limited [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in cladribine pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with pantoprazole or interferon beta-1a. No clinically significant differences in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics were observed when a combined oral hormonal contraceptive (containing 150 mcg levonorgestrel and 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) was used concomitantly with cladribine. In Vitro Studies It has been reported that lamivudine can inhibit the phosphorylation of cladribine intracellularly. Potential competition for intracellular phosphorylation exists between cladribine and compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Cladribine is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes and does not show significant potential to act as inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Cladribine has no clinically meaningful inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Cladribine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3). Inhibition of BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract may increase the oral bioavailability and systemic exposure of cladribine. Intracellular distribution and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3 transporter inhibitors."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of cladribine tablets was demonstrated in a 96-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing forms of MS (Study 1; NCT00213135). Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median age was 39 years (range 18 to 65) and the female-to-male ratio was approximately 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study enrollment was 8.7 years, and the median baseline neurological disability based on Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score across all treatment groups was 3. Over two thirds of the study patients were treatment-naive for drugs used to treat relapsing forms of MS. 1,326 patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dosage of cladribine 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg per kg body weight (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. Patients randomized to the 3.5 mg per kg cumulative dose received a first treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the first year and a second treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the second year [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients randomized to the 5.25 mg per kg cumulative dose received additional treatment at Weeks 9 and 13 of the first year. Higher cumulative doses did not add any clinically meaningful benefit, but were associated with a higher incidence in grade 3 lymphopenia or higher (44.9% in the 5.25 mg per kg group vs. 25.6% in the 3.5 mg per kg group). Ninety-two percent of patients treated with cladribine 3.5 mg per kg and 87% of patients receiving placebo completed the full 96 weeks of the study. The primary outcome of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Additional outcome measures included the proportion of patients with confirmed disability progression, the time to first qualifying relapse, the mean number of MRI T1 Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, and new or enlarging MRI T2 hyperintense lesions. Disability progression was measured in terms of a 3-month sustained change in EDSS score of at least one point, if baseline EDSS score was between 0.5 and 4.5 inclusively, or at least 1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was at least 5, over a period of at least 3 months. Cladribine 3.5 mg per kg significantly lowered the annualized relapse rate. The results from Study 1 are presented in Table 4. Table 4 Clinical Outcomes in Study 1 (96 Weeks) - Primary and Secondary Endpoints Endpoints Cladribine Cumulative Dose 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) Placebo (n = 437) Clinical Endpoints Annualized relapse rate (ARR) 0.14* 0.33 Relative reduction in ARR 58% Proportion of patients without relapse 81%** 63% Time to 3-month confirmed EDSS progression, HR 0.67** Proportion of patients with 3-month EDSS progression 13% 19% MRI Endpoints Median Number of Active T1 Gd+ Lesions 0* 0.33 Median Number of Active T2 Lesions 0* 0.67 * p < 0.001 compared to placebo ** nominal p < 0.05 compared to placebo HR: Hazard Ratio"

Cladribine tablets can cause serious side effects, including: Risk of cancer (malignancies). Treatment with cladribine tablets may increase your risk of developing cancer. Talk to your healthcare provider about your risk of developing cancer if you receive cladribine tablets. You should follow your healthcare provider's instructions about screening for cancer. Cladribine tablets may cause birth defects if used during pregnancy. Women must not be pregnant when they start treatment with cladribine tablets or become pregnant during cladribine tablets dosing and within 6 months after the last dose of each yearly treatment course. Stop your treatment with cladribine tablets and call your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant during treatment with cladribine tablets. For women who are able to become pregnant: Your healthcare provider should order a pregnancy test for you before you begin your first and second yearly treatment course of cladribine tablets to make sure that you are not pregnant. Your healthcare provider will decide when to do the test. Use effective birth control (contraception) on the days on which you take cladribine tablets and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each yearly treatment course. Ask your healthcare provider which contraception method is right for you. For men with female partners who are able to become pregnant: Use effective birth control (contraception) during the days on which you take cladribine tablets and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each yearly treatment course. What are cladribine tablets? Cladribine tablets are prescription medicine used to treat relapsing form of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include relapsing-remitting disease in adults. Because of its risks, cladribine tablets are generally used in people who have tried another MS medicine that they could not tolerate or that has not worked well enough. Cladribine tablets are not recommended for use in people with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). It is not known if cladribine tablets are safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Do not take cladribine tablets if you: have cancer (malignancy). are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are a woman of childbearing age or a man able to father a child and you are not using birth control. See \u201c What is the most important information I should know about cladribine tablets? \u201d are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. have active infections, including tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B or C. are allergic to cladribine. are breastfeeding. See \u201c Before you take cladribine tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u201d Before you take cladribine tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: think you have an infection. have heart failure. have liver or kidney problems. have taken, take, or plan to take medicines that affect your immune system or your blood cells, or other treatments for MS. Certain medicines can increase your risk of getting an infection. have had a recent vaccination or are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive live or live- attenuated vaccines within the 4 to 6 weeks before you start your treatment with cladribine tablets. You should not receive these types of vaccines during your treatment with cladribine tablets and until your healthcare provider tells you that your immune system is no longer weakened. have or have had cancer. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if cladribine passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed on the days on which you take cladribine tablets, and for 10 days after the last dose. See \u201c Do not take cladribine tablets if you:\u201d Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How should I take cladribine tablets? Cladribine tablets are given as two yearly treatment courses. Each yearly treatment course consists of 2 treatment weeks (also called cycles) that will be about a month apart. Your healthcare provider will tell you when you have to start your treatment weeks and how many tablets per week you need, depending on your weight. Each treatment week is 4 or 5 days. Your pharmacist will dispense a carton of cladribine tablets for each treatment week. The prescribed number of tablets per day are provided in child resistant day packs. Take cladribine tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Do not change your dose or stop taking cladribine tablets unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Take cladribine tablets with water and swallow whole without chewing. Cladribine tablets can be taken with or without food. Swallow cladribine tablets right away after opening the blister pack. Your hands must be dry when handling cladribine tablets and washed well with water afterwards. Limit contact with your skin. Avoid touching your nose, eyes and other parts of the body. If you get cladribine tablets on your skin or on any surface, wash it right away with water. Take cladribine tablets at least 3 hours apart from other medicines taken by mouth during the 4- to 5- day cladribine treatment week. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If the whole day passes before you remember, take your missed dose the next day. Do not take 2 doses at the same time . Instead, you will extend the number of days in that treatment week. Your healthcare provider will continue to monitor your health during the 2 yearly treatment courses, and for at least another 2 years during which you do not need to take cladribine tablets. It is not known if cladribine tablets are safe and effective in people who restart cladribine treatment more than 2 years after completing 2 yearly treatment courses. What are the possible side effects of cladribine tablets? Cladribine tablets can cause serious side effects, including: See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about cladribine tablets?\u201d low blood cell counts . Low blood cell counts have happened and can increase your risk of infections during your treatment with cladribine tablets. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before you start treatment with cladribine tablets, during your treatment with cladribine tablets, and afterward, as needed. serious infections such as: Infections caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi that may be life-threatening or cause death. TB, hepatitis B or C, and shingles (herpes zoster). Fatal cases of TB and hepatitis have happened with cladribine during clinical studies. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any symptoms of the following infection related problems or if any of the symptoms get worse, including: fever loss of appetite aching painful muscles burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area headache skin blotches, blistered rash and severe pain feeling of being generally unwell progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability. Although PML has not been seen in MS patients taking cladribine tablets, it may happen in people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms of PML get worse over days to weeks. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening neurologic signs or symptoms of PML, that have lasted several days, including: weakness on 1 side of your body changes in your vision loss of coordination in your arms and legs changes in your thinking or memory decreased strength confusion problems with balance changes in your personality liver problems. Cladribine tablets may cause liver damage. Your risk of developing serious liver problems may be higher if you already have liver problems or take other medicines that also affect your liver. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your liver: before you start taking cladribine tablets before each course and cycle of cladribine tablets treatment Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: nausea loss of appetite vomiting your skin or the whites or your eyes turn yellow stomach pain dark urine tiredness allergic reactions (hypersensitivities) . Cladribine tablets can cause serious allergic reactions. Stop your treatment with cladribine tablets and go to the closest emergency room for medical help right away if you have any signs or symptoms of allergic reactions. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: skin rash, swelling or itching of the face, lips, tongue or throat, or trouble breathing. heart failure . Cladribine tablets may cause heart failure, which means your heart may not pump as well as it should. Call your healthcare provider or go to the closest emergency room for medical help right away if you have any signs or symptoms such as shortness of breath, a fast or irregular heartbeat, or unusual swelling in your body. Your healthcare provider may delay or completely stop treatment with cladribine tablets if you have severe side effects.

      "WARNING Cladribine injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy. Suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated. This is usually reversible and appears to be dose dependent. Serious neurological toxicity (including irreversible paraparesis and quadraparesis) has been reported in patients who received cladribine injection by continuous infusion at high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia). Neurologic toxicity appears to demonstrate a dose relationship; however, severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Acute nephrotoxicity has been observed with high doses of cladribine (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia), especially when given concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Cladribine Injection, USP (also commonly known as 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine) is a synthetic antineoplastic agent for continuous intravenous infusion. It is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution. Cladribine injection, USP is available in single-dose vials containing 10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine, a chlorinated purine nucleoside analog. Each milliliter of cladribine injection, USP contains 1 mg of the active ingredient and 9 mg (0.15 mEq) of sodium chloride as an inactive ingredient. The solution has a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0. Phosphoric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added to adjust the pH to 6.3\u00b10.3. The chemical name for cladribine is 2-chloro-6-amino-9-(2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-erythropento-furanosyl) purine and the structure is represented below: Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity The selective toxicity of 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy-\u03b2-D-adenosine towards certain normal and malignant lymphocyte and monocyte populations is based on the relative activities of deoxycytidine kinase and deoxynucleotidase. Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane. In cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). Since 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in lymphocytes and monocytes, 2-CdAMP accumulates intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide, 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP). It is postulated that cells with high deoxycytidine kinase and low deoxynucleotidase activities will be selectively killed by 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine as toxic deoxynucleotides accumulate intracellularly. Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism. There is evidence, also, that 2-CdATP is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA synthesis. Thus, 2-chloro-2\u0384-deoxy- \u03b2 -D-adenosine can be distinguished from other chemotherapeutic agents affecting purine metabolism in that it is cytotoxic to both actively dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, inhibiting both DNA synthesis and repair. Pharmacokinetics In a clinical investigation, 17 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia and normal renal function were treated for 7 days with the recommended treatment regimen of cladribine injection (0.09 mg/kg/day) by continuous intravenous infusion. The mean steady-state serum concentration was estimated to be 5.7 ng/mL with an estimated systemic clearance of 663.5 mL/h/kg when cladribine was given by continuous infusion over 7 days. In Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, there does not appear to be a relationship between serum concentrations and ultimate clinical outcome. In another study, 8 patients with hematologic malignancies received a two (2) hour infusion of cladribine injection (0.12 mg/kg). The mean end-of-infusion plasma cladribine concentration was 48\u00b119 ng/mL. For 5 of these patients, the disappearance of cladribine could be described by either a biphasic or triphasic decline. For these patients with normal renal function, the mean terminal half-life was 5.4 hours. Mean values for clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 978\u00b1422 mL/h/kg and 4.5\u00b12.8 L/kg, respectively. Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous administration declines multi-exponentially with an average half-life of 6.7 +/- 2.5 hours. In general, the apparent volume of distribution of cladribine is approximately 9 L/kg, indicating an extensive distribution in body tissues. Cladribine penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid. One report indicates that concentrations are approximately 25% of those in plasma. Cladribine is bound approximately 20% to plasma proteins. Except for some understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity, no other information is available on the metabolism of cladribine in humans. An average of 18% of the administered dose has been reported to be excreted in urine of patients with solid tumors during a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of 3.5\u20138.1 mg/m 2 /day of cladribine. The effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the elimination of cladribine has not been investigated in humans."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Two single-center open label studies of cladribine injection have been conducted in patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia with evidence of active disease requiring therapy. In the study conducted at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Study A), 89 patients were treated with a single course of cladribine injection given by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. In the study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Study B), 35 patients were treated with a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine injection at a comparable dose of 3.6 mg/m 2 /day. A complete response (CR) required clearing of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of hairy cells and recovery of the hemoglobin to 12 g/dL, platelet count to 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and absolute neutrophil count to 1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L. A good partial response (GPR) required the same hematologic parameters as a complete response, and that fewer than 5% hairy cells remain in the bone marrow. A partial response (PR) required that hairy cells in the bone marrow be decreased by at least 50% from baseline and the same response for hematologic parameters as for complete response. A pathologic relapse was defined as an increase in bone marrow hairy cells to 25% of pretreatment levels. A clinical relapse was defined as the recurrence of cytopenias, specifically, decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 2 g/dL, ANC \u2265 25% or platelet counts \u2265 50,000. Patients who met the criteria for a complete response but subsequently were found to have evidence of bone marrow hairy cells (< 25% of pretreatment levels) were reclassified as partial responses and were not considered to be complete responses with relapse. Among patients evaluable for efficacy (N=106), using the hematologic and bone marrow response criteria described above, the complete response rates in patients treated with cladribine injection were 65% and 68% for Study A and Study B, respectively, yielding a combined complete response rate of 66%. Overall response rates (i.e., Complete plus Good Partial plus Partial Responses) were 89% and 86% in Study A and Study B, respectively, for a combined overall response rate of 88% in evaluable patients treated with cladribine injection. Using an intent-to-treat analysis (N=123) and further requiring no evidence of splenomegaly as a criterion for CR (i.e., no palpable spleen on physical examination and \u2264 13 cm on CT scan), the complete response rates for Study A and Study B were 54% and 53%, respectively, giving a combined CR rate of 54%. The overall response rates (CR + GPR + PR) were 90% and 85%, for Studies A and B, respectively, yielding a combined overall response rate of 89%. RESPONSE RATES TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA CR Overall Evaluable Patients N=106 66% 88% Intent-to-treat Population N=123 54% 89% In these studies, 60% of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy for Hairy Cell Leukemia or had undergone splenectomy as the only prior treatment and were receiving cladribine as a first-line treatment. The remaining 40% of the patients received cladribine as a second-line treatment, having been treated previously with other agents, including \u03b1-interferon and/or deoxycoformycin. The overall response rate for patients without prior chemotherapy was 92%, compared with 84% for previously treated patients. Cladribine is active in previously treated patients; however, retrospective analysis suggests that the overall response rate is decreased in patients previously treated with splenectomy or deoxycoformycin and in patients refractory to \u03b1-interferon. OVERALL RESPONSE RATES (CR + GPR + PR) TO CLADRIBINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA OVERALL RESPONSE (N = 123) NR + RELAPSE NR = No Response No Prior Chemotherapy 68/74 92% 6 + 4 14% Any Prior Chemotherapy 41/49 84% 8 + 3 22% Previous Splenectomy 32/41 P < 0.05 78% 9 + 1 24% Previous Interferon 40/48 83% 8 + 3 23% Interferon Refractory 6/11 55% 5 + 2 64% Previous Deoxycoformycin 3/6 50% 3 + 1 66% After a reversible decline, normalization of peripheral blood counts (Hemoglobin >12.0 g/dL, Platelets >100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L) was achieved by 92% of evaluable patients. The median time to normalization of peripheral counts was 9 weeks from the start of treatment (Range: 2 to 72). The median time to normalization of Platelet Count was two weeks, the median time to normalization of ANC was 5 weeks and the median time to normalization of Hemoglobin was 8 weeks. With normalization of Platelet Count and Hemoglobin, requirements for platelet and RBC transfusions were abolished after Months 1 and 2, respectively, in those patients with complete response. Platelet recovery may be delayed in a minority of patients with severe baseline thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to normalization of ANC, a trend toward a reduced incidence of infection was seen after the third month, when compared to the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. (see also WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) cladribine TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA TIME TO NORMALIZATION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNTS Parameter Median Time to Normalization of Count Day 1 = First day of infusion Platelet Count 2 weeks Absolute Neutrophil Count 5 weeks Hemoglobin 8 weeks ANC, Hemoglobin and Platelet Count 9 weeks For patients achieving a complete response, the median time to response (i.e., absence of hairy cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood together with normalization of peripheral blood parameters), measured from treatment start, was approximately 4 months. Since bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were frequently not performed at the time of peripheral blood normalization, the median time to complete response may actually be shorter than that which was recorded. At the time of data cut-off, the median duration of complete response was greater than 8 months and ranged to 25+ months. Among 93 responding patients, seven had shown evidence of disease progression at the time of the data cut-off. In four of these patients, disease was limited to the bone marrow without peripheral blood abnormalities (pathologic progression), while in three patients there were also peripheral blood abnormalities (clinical progression). Seven patients who did not respond to a first course of cladribine received a second course of therapy. In the five patients who had adequate follow-up, additional courses did not appear to improve their overall response."

      "WARNINGS Due to increased risk of infection in the setting of immunosuppression with chemotherapy including cladribine, it is recommended not to administer live attenuated vaccines to patients receiving cladribine injection. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been commonly observed in patients treated with cladribine, especially at high doses. At initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had hematologic impairment as a manifestation of active Hairy Cell Leukemia. Following treatment with cladribine, further hematologic impairment occurred before recovery of peripheral blood counts began. During the first two weeks after treatment initiation, mean Platelet Count, ANC, and Hemoglobin concentration declined and subsequently increased with normalization of mean counts by Day 12, Week 5 and Week 8, respectively. The myelosuppressive effects of cladribine were most notable during the first month following treatment. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients received transfusions with RBCs and 14% received transfusions with platelets during Month 1. Careful hematologic monitoring, especially during the first 4 to 8 weeks after treatment with cladribine injection, is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fever (T \u2265 100\u00b0F) was associated with the use of cladribine in approximately two-thirds of patients (131/196) in the first month of therapy. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with parenteral antibiotics. Overall, 47% (93/196) of all patients had fever in the setting of neutropenia (ANC \u2264 1000), including 62 patients (32%) with severe neutropenia (i.e., ANC \u2264 500). In a Phase I investigational study using cladribine in high doses (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) as part of a bone marrow transplant conditioning regimen, which also included high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, acute nephrotoxicity and delayed onset neurotoxicity were observed. Thirty-one (31) poor-risk patients with drug-resistant acute leukemia in relapse (29 cases) or non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (2 cases) received cladribine for 7 to 14 days prior to bone marrow transplantation. During infusion, 8 patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. While the bone marrow was initially cleared of all hematopoietic elements, including tumor cells, leukemia eventually recurred in all treated patients. Within 7 to 13 days after starting treatment with cladribine, 6 patients (19%) developed manifestations of renal dysfunction (e.g., acidosis, anuria, elevated serum creatinine, etc.) and 5 required dialysis. Several of these patients were also being treated with other medications having known nephrotoxic potential. Renal dysfunction was reversible in 2 of these patients. In the 4 patients whose renal function had not recovered at the time of death, autopsies were performed; in 2 of these, evidence of tubular damage was noted. Eleven (11) patients (35%) experienced delayed onset neurologic toxicity. In the majority, this was characterized by progressive irreversible motor weakness (paraparesis/quadriparesis) of the upper and/or lower extremities, first noted 35 to 84 days after starting high dose therapy with cladribine. Non-invasive testing (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) was consistent with demyelinating disease. Severe neurologic toxicity has also been noted with high doses of another drug in this class. Axonal peripheral polyneuropathy was observed in a dose escalation study at the highest dose levels (approximately 4 times the recommended dose for Hairy Cell Leukemia) in patients not receiving cyclophosphamide or total body irradiation. Severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. In patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia treated with the recommended treatment regimen (0.09 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days), there have been no reports of nephrologic toxicities. Serious (e.g. respiratory infection, pneumonia and viral skin infections), including fatal infections (e.g. sepsis) were reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Of the 196 Hairy Cell Leukemia patients entered in the two trials, there were 8 deaths following treatment. Of these, 6 were of infectious etiology, including 3 pneumonias, and 2 occurred in the first month following cladribine therapy. Of the 8 deaths, 6 occurred in previously treated patients who were refractory to \u03b1 interferon. Benzyl alcohol is a constituent of the recommended diluent for the 7-day infusion solution. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Pregnancy Category D Cladribine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Although there is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans due to cladribine, other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis have been reported to be teratogenic in humans. Cladribine is teratogenic in animals. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with cladribine. If cladribine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Cladribine is teratogenic in mice and rabbits and consequently has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. A significant increase in fetal variations was observed in mice receiving 1.5 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m 2 ) and increased resorptions, reduced litter size and increased fetal malformations were observed when mice received 3.0 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m 2 ). Fetal death and malformations were observed in rabbits that received 3.0 mg/kg/day (33.0 mg/m 2 ). No fetal effects were seen in mice at 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/m 2 ) or in rabbits at 1.0 mg/kg/day (11.0 mg/m 2 )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Development of acute renal insufficiency in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described. Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic insufficiency (see WARNINGS ). Rare cases of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden. Cladribine injection must be diluted in designated intravenous solutions prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Laboratory Tests During and following treatment, the patient's hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1500 \u00d7 10 6 /L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8. After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine. Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies. Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated. Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with cladribine injection. Caution should be exercised if cladribine injection is administered before, after, or in conjunction with other drugs known to cause immunosuppression or myelosuppression. (see WARNINGS ) Carcinogenesis No animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cladribine. However, its carcinogenic potential cannot be excluded based on demonstrated genotoxicity of cladribine. Mutagenesis As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage. In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cladribine was not mutagenic in vitro (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. However, cladribine was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility The effect on human fertility is unknown. When administered intravenously to Cynomolgus monkeys, cladribine has been shown to cause suppression of rapidly generating cells, including testicular cells. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a Phase I study involving patients 1\u201321 years old with relapsed acute leukemia, cladribine was given by continuous intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 3 to 10.7 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (one-half to twice the dose recommended in Hairy Cell Leukemia). In this study, the dose-limiting toxicity was severe myelosuppression with profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At the highest dose (10.7 mg/m 2 /day), 3 of 7 patients developed irreversible myelosuppression and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. No unique toxicities were noted in this study (1) (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cladribine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ).

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience Adverse drug reactions reported by \u2265 1% of cladribine-treated patients with HCL noted in the HCL clinical dataset (studies K90-091 and L91-048, n=576) are shown in the table below. Adverse Drug Reactions in \u2265 1% of Patients Treated with Cladribine in HCL Clinical Trials System Organ Class Preferred Term Cladribine (n=576) % Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder (see also sections WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Anemia 1 Febrile neutropenia 8 Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 1 Insomnia 3 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 6 Headache 14 Cardiac Disorders Tachycardia 2 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Breath sounds abnormal 4 Cough 7 Dyspnea Dyspnea includes dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, and wheezing 5 Rales 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain Abdominal pain includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain (lower and upper) 4 Constipation 4 Diarrhea 7 Flatulence 1 Nausea 22 Vomiting 9 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Ecchymosis 2 Hyperhidrosis 3 Petechiae 2 Pruritus 2 Rash Rash includes erythema, rash, and rash (macular, macula-papular, papular, pruritic, pustular and erythematous) 16 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders Arthralgia 3 Myalgia 6 Pain Pain includes pain, back pain, chest pain, arthritis pain, bone pain, and pain in extremity 6 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (see also sections WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Administration site reaction Administration site reaction includes administration site reaction, catheter site (cellulitis, erythema, hemorrhage, and pain), and infusion site reaction(erythema, edema, and pain) 11 Asthenia 6 Chills 2 Decreased appetite 8 Fatigue 31 Malaise 5 Muscular weakness 1 Edema peripheral 2 Pyrexia 33 Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications Contusion 1 The following safety data are based on 196 patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia: the original cohort of 124 patients plus an additional 72 patients enrolled at the same two centers after the original enrollment cutoff. In Month 1 of the Hairy Cell Leukemia clinical trials, severe neutropenia was noted in 70% of patients, fever in 69%, and infection was documented in 28%. Most non-hematologic adverse experiences were mild to moderate in severity. Myelosuppression was frequently observed during the first month after starting treatment. Neutropenia (ANC < 500 \u00d7 10 6 /L) was noted in 70% of patients, compared with 26% in whom it was present initially. Severe anemia (Hemoglobin < 8.5 g/dL) developed in 37% of patients, compared with 10% initially and thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L) developed in 12% of patients, compared to 4% in whom it was noted initially. During the first month, 54 of 196 patients (28%) exhibited documented evidence of infection. Serious infections (e.g., septicemia, pneumonia) were reported in 6% of all patients; the remainder were mild or moderate. Several deaths were attributable to infection and/or complications related to the underlying disease. During the second month, the overall rate of documented infection was 6%; these infections were mild to moderate and no severe systemic infections were seen. After the third month, the monthly incidence of infection was either less than or equal to that of the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. During the first month, 11% of patients experienced severe fever (i.e., \u2265104\u00b0F). Documented infections were noted in fewer than one-third of febrile episodes. Of the 196 patients studied, 19 were noted to have a documented infection in the month prior to treatment. In the month following treatment, there were 54 episodes of documented infection: 23 (42%) were bacterial, 11 (20%) were viral and 11 (20%) were fungal. Seven (7) of 8 documented episodes of herpes zoster occurred during the month following treatment. Fourteen (14) of 16 episodes of documented fungal infections occurred in the first two months following treatment. Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with antibiotics. (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Analysis of lymphocyte subsets indicates that treatment with cladribine is associated with prolonged depression of the CD4 counts. Prior to treatment, the mean CD4 count was 766/\u00b5L. The mean CD4 count nadir, which occurred 4 to 6 months following treatment, was 272/\u00b5L. Fifteen (15) months after treatment, mean CD4 counts remained below 500/\u00b5L. CD8 counts behaved similarly, though increasing counts were observed after 9 months. The clinical significance of the prolonged CD4 lymphopenia is unclear. Another event of unknown clinical significance includes the observation of prolonged bone marrow hypocellularity. Bone marrow cellularity of < 35% was noted after 4 months in 42 of 124 patients (34%) treated in the two pivotal trials. This hypocellularity was noted as late as Day 1010. It is not known whether the hypocellularity is the result of disease related marrow fibrosis or if it is the result of cladribine toxicity. There was no apparent clinical effect on the peripheral blood counts. The vast majority of rashes were mild. Most episodes of nausea were mild, not accompanied by vomiting, and did not require treatment with antiemetics. In patients requiring antiemetics, nausea was easily controlled, most frequently with chlorpromazine. When used in other clinical settings the following ADRs were reported: bacteremia, cellulitis, localized infection, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (with bleeding or petechiae), phlebitis, purpura, crepitations, localized edema and edema. For a description of adverse reactions associated with use of high doses in non-Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, see WARNINGS . Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported since the drug became commercially available. These adverse reactions have been reported primarily in patients who received multiple courses of cladribine injection: Infections and infestations: Septic shock. Opportunistic infections have occurred in the acute phase of treatment. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Bone marrow suppression with prolonged pancytopenia, including some reports of aplastic anemia; hemolytic anemia (including autoimmune hemolytic anemia), which was reported in patients with lymphoid malignancies, occurring within the first few weeks following treatment. Rare cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Tumor lysis syndrome. Psychiatric disorders : Confusion (including disorientation). Hepatobiliary disorders : Reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases. Nervous System disorders : Depressed level of consciousness, neurological toxicity (including peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy (paralysis), polyneuropathy, paraparesis); however, severe neurotoxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens. Eye disorders : Conjunctivitis. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (including lung infiltration, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis); in most cases, an infectious etiology was identified. Skin and tissue disorders : Urticaria, hypereosinophilia; Stevens-Johnson. In isolated cases toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with other medications (e.g., allopurinol or antibiotics) known to cause these syndromes. Renal and urinary disorders: Renal failure (including renal failure acute, renal impairment)."

      "OVERDOSAGE High doses of cladribine have been associated with: irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), acute nephrotoxicity, and severe bone marrow suppression resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS ). There is no known specific antidote to overdosage. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of cladribine, careful observation and appropriate supportive measures. It is not known whether the drug can be removed from the circulation by dialysis or hemofiltration."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual Dose The recommended dose and schedule of cladribine injection, USP for active Hairy Cell Leukemia is as a single course given by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day. Deviations from this dosage regimen are not advised. If the patient does not respond to the initial course of cladribine injection, USP for Hairy Cell Leukemia, it is unlikely that they will benefit from additional courses. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity or renal toxicity occurs (see WARNINGS ). Specific risk factors predisposing to increased toxicity from cladribine have not been defined. In view of the known toxicities of agents of this class, it would be prudent to proceed carefully in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency or severe bone marrow impairment of any etiology. Patients should be monitored closely for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solutions Cladribine injection, USP must be diluted with the designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of cladribine injection solutions. To prepare a single daily dose Cladribine injection, USP should be passed through a sterile 0.22\u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag, prior to each daily infusion. Add the calculated dose (0.09 mg/kg or 0.09 mL/kg) of cladribine injection, USP through the sterile filter to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Infuse continuously over 24 hours. Repeat daily for a total of 7 consecutive days. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended because of increased degradation of cladribine. Admixtures of cladribine injection, USP are chemically and physically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal room fluorescent light in Baxter Viaflex \u00ae PVC infusion containers. Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Dose of Cladribine Injection, USP Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 24-hour infusion method 1(day) \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 500 mL To prepare a 7-day infusion The 7-day infusion solution should only be prepared with Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved). In order to minimize the risk of microbial contamination, both cladribine injection, USP and the diluent should be passed through a sterile 0.22 \u00b5m disposable hydrophilic syringe filter as each solution is being introduced into the infusion reservoir. First add the calculated dose of cladribine injection, USP (7 days \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg or mL/kg) to the infusion reservoir through the sterile filter. Then add a calculated amount of Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol preserved) also through the filter to bring the total volume of the solution to 100 mL. After completing solution preparation, clamp off the line, disconnect and discard the filter. Aseptically aspirate air bubbles from the reservoir as necessary using the syringe and a dry second sterile filter or a sterile vent filter assembly. Reclamp the line and discard the syringe and filter assembly. Infuse continuously over 7 days. Solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection for individuals weighing more than 85 kg may have reduced preservative effectiveness due to greater dilution of the benzyl alcohol preservative. Admixtures for the 7-day infusion have demonstrated acceptable chemical and physical stability for at least 7 days in the SIMS Deltec MEDICATION CASSETTE\u2122 Reservoir. Dose of Cladribine Injection, USP Recommended Diluent Quantity of Diluent 7-day infusion method (use sterile 0.22\u00b5 filter when preparing infusion solution) 7 (days) \u00d7 0.09 mg/kg Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol) q.s. to 100 mL Since limited compatibility data are available, adherence to the recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised. Solutions containing cladribine injection, USP should not be mixed with other intravenous drugs or additives or infused simultaneously via a common intravenous line, since compatibility testing has not been performed. Preparations containing benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates (see WARNINGS ). Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Once diluted, solutions of cladribine injection, USP should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C) for no more than 8 hours prior to start of administration. Vials of cladribine injection, USP are for single-use only. Any unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner (see Handling and Disposal ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A precipitate may occur during the exposure of cladribine injection, USP to low temperatures; it may be resolubilized by allowing the solution to warm naturally to room temperature and by shaking vigorously. DO NOT HEAT OR MICROWAVE. Chemical Stability of Vials When stored in refrigerated conditions between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) protected from light, unopened vials of cladribine injection, USP are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package. Freezing does not adversely affect the solution. If freezing occurs, thaw naturally to room temperature. DO NOT heat or microwave. Once thawed, the vial of cladribine injection, USP is stable until expiry if refrigerated. DO NOT refreeze. Once diluted, solutions containing cladribine injection, USP should be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for no more than 8 hours prior to administration. Handling and Disposal The potential hazards associated with cytotoxic agents are well established and proper precautions should be taken when handling, preparing, and administering cladribine injection, USP. The use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended. If cladribine injection, USP contacts the skin or mucous membranes, wash the involved surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. (2\u20138) There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. Refer to your Institution's guidelines and all applicable state/local regulations for disposal of cytotoxic waste."
