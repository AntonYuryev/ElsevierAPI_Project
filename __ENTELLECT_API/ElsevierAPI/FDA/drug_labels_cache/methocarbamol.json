    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 grams per day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight-hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol Injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Therefore, Methocarbamol tablets, USP should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see Precautions, Pregnancy). Use In Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Information for patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug interactions See Warnings and Precautions for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/laboratory test interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol tablets, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of Methocarbamol tablets, USP has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol tablets, USP should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see Warnings). Nursing mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Methocarbamol tablets, USP are administered to a nursing woman.

Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

      "DESCRIPTION Methocarbamol tablets, USP, a carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, are a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with sedative and musculoskeletal relaxant properties. The chemical name of methocarbamol is 3-(2-meth-oxyphenoxy)-1,2-propanediol 1-carbamate and has the empirical formula C 11 H 15 NO 5 . Its molecular weight is 241.24. The structural formula is shown below. Methocarbamol, USP is a white powder, sparingly soluble in water and chloroform, soluble in alcohol (only with heating) and propylene glycol, and insoluble in benzene and n -hexane. Methocarbamol tablets, USP are available as 500 mg and 750 mg tablets for oral administration. Methocarbamol tablets USP, 500 mg and 750 mg contain the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, povidone, and sodium starch glycolate. Figure 1 structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

      "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Safe use of Methocarbamol tablets has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The injectable form of methocarbamol is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol Injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of Methocarbamol Injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol Injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving Methocarbamol Injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of Methocarbamol Injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol Injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute\u2013i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since Methocarbamol Injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of Methocarbamol Injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol Injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Methocarbamol Injection is administered to a nursing woman.

In post-marketing experience deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs. Treatment Management of overdose includes symptomatic and supportive treatment. Supportive measures include maintenance of an adequate airway, monitoring urinary output and vital signs, and administration of intravenous fluids if necessary. The usefulness of hemodialysis in managing overdose is unknown."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 grams per day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute . It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol Injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

The chemical name of methocarbamol is 3-(2-meth-oxyphenoxy)-1,2-propanediol 1-carbamate and has the empirical formula C 11 H 15 NO 5 . Its molecular weight is 241.24. The structural formula is shown below. Methocarbamol is a white powder, sparingly soluble in water and chloroform, soluble in alcohol (only with heating) and propylene glycol, and insoluble in benzene and n -hexane. Methocarbamol tablets, USP are available as 500 mg and 750 mg tablets for oral administration. Methocarbamol tablets, USP 500 mg and 750 mg contain the following inactive ingredients: povidone, sodium starch glycolate and magnesium stearate. structural formula"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean [\u00b1 SD]elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age-and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half- life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "DESCRIPTION Methocarbamol Tablets, USP, 500 mg and 750 mg, a carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with sedative and musculoskeletal relaxant properties. The chemical name of methocarbamol is 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1, 2-propanediol 1-carbamate and has the empirical formula C 11 H 15 NO 5 . Its molecular weight is 241.24. The structural formula is shown below. Methocarbamol is a white powder, sparingly soluble in water and chloroform, soluble in alcohol (only with heating) and propylene glycol, and insoluble in benzene and n -hexane. Each tablet, for oral administration, contains either 500 mg or 750 mg of methocarbamol, USP. The inactive ingredients present are colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, povidone, pregelatinized corn starch, purified water, sodium starch glycolate, and stearic acid."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hour, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of Methocarbamol injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute-i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since methocarbamol injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injection form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when methocarbamol injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of methocarbamol injection in pediatric patients have not been established except in tetanus.

In post-marketing experience deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs. Treatment Management of overdose includes symptomatic and supportive treatment. Supportive measures include maintenance of an adequate airway, monitoring urinary output and vital signs, and administration of intravenous fluids if necessary. The usefulness of hemodialysis in managing overdose is unknown."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only . Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH I.V. INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For pediatric patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid. See directions for I.V. use."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half- life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half- life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol.

      "DESCRIPTION Methocarbamol Tablets, USP, 500 mg and 750 mg, a carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with sedative and musculoskeletal relaxant properties. The chemical name of methocarbamol is 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1, 2-propanediol 1-carbamate and has the empirical formula C 11 H 15 NO 5 . Its molecular weight is 241.24. The structural formula is shown below. Methocarbamol is a white powder, sparingly soluble in water and chloroform, soluble in alcohol (only with heating) and propylene glycol, and insoluble in benzene and n -hexane. Each tablet, for oral administration, contains either 500 mg or 750 mg of methocarbamol, USP. The inactive ingredients present are colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, povidone, pregelatinized corn starch, purified water, sodium starch glycolate, and stearic acid."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The injectable form of methocarbamol is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of methocarbamol injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute-i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since methocarbamol injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when methocarbamol injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of methocarbamol injection in pediatric patients have not been established except in tetanus. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Special Directions for Use in Tetanus , For Pediatric Patients."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for intravenous infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For pediatric patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by intravenous infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid. See directions for intravenous use."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Cinical Pharmacology The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Safe use of Methocarbamol tablets has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, PREGNANCY ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. DRUG INTERACTIONS See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS Methocarbamol may cause color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method.

      "Warnings Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol tablets should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, PREGNANCY). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

      "Precautions Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when methocarbamol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of methocarbamol in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established."

Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol Injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of Methocarbamol Injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol Injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving Methocarbamol Injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of Methocarbamol Injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol Injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute\u2013i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since Methocarbamol Injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of Methocarbamol Injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol Injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 grams per day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight-hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol Injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute . It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH I.V. INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hour, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of methocarbamol is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute-i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since methocarbamol is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects-Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS ). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when methocarbamol is administered to a nursing woman.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only . Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for intravenous infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For pediatric patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours if required.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hour, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Methocarbamol Injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of Methocarbamol Injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol Injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."

Safe use of Methocarbamol Injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, Methocarbamol Injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute\u2013i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since Methocarbamol Injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injection form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed.

In post-marketing experience deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs. Treatment Management of overdose includes symptomatic and supportive treatment. Supportive measures include maintenance of an adequate airway, monitoring urinary output and vital signs, and administration of intravenous fluids if necessary. The usefulness of hemodialysis in managing overdose is unknown."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only . Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute. It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for intravenous infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol Injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For pediatric patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by intravenous infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid. See directions for intravenous use."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute - i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since Methocarbamol Injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only . Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 grams per day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol Injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute . It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH INTRAVENOUS INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight-hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol Injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults: Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients: A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid.

      "Clinical Pharmacology The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hour, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The injectable form of methocarbamol is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of methocarbamol injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, PREGNANCY). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute\u2212i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since methocarbamol injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug and/or Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute . It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single-dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH I.V. INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid. See directions for I.V. use."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b10.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b1 0.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 69 (\u00b14) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b18.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b10.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hour, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally Impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (\u00b10.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively). Hepatically Impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b11.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b10.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The injectable form of methocarbamol is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Methocarbamol injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle. A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of methocarbamol injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. Methocarbamol injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol injection should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol injection has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been very rare reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol injection should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other agents administered either intravenously or intramuscularly, careful supervision of dose and rate of injection should be observed. Rate of injection should not exceed 3 mL per minute\u2212i.e., one 10 mL vial in approximately three minutes. Since methocarbamol injection is hypertonic, vascular extravasation must be avoided. A recumbent position will reduce the likelihood of side reactions. Blood aspirated into the syringe does not mix with the hypertonic solution. This phenomenon occurs with many other intravenous preparations. The blood may be injected with the methocarbamol, or the injection may be stopped when the plunger reaches the blood, whichever the physician prefers. The total dosage should not exceed 30 mL (three vials) a day for more than three consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days. Directions for Intravenous Use Methocarbamol injection may be administered undiluted directly into the vein at a maximum rate of three mL per minute . It may also be added to an intravenous drip of Sodium Chloride Injection (Sterile Isotonic Sodium Chloride Solution for Parenteral Use) or five percent Dextrose Injection (Sterile 5 percent Dextrose Solution); one vial given as a single-dose should not be diluted to more than 250 mL for I.V. infusion. AFTER MIXING WITH I.V. INFUSION FLUIDS, DO NOT REFRIGERATE . Care should be exercised to avoid vascular extravasation of this hypertonic solution, which may result in thrombophlebitis. It is preferable that the patient be in a recumbent position during and for at least 10 to 15 minutes following the injection. Directions for Intramuscular Use When the intramuscular route is indicated, not more than five mL (one-half vial) should be injected into each gluteal region. The injections may be repeated at eight hour intervals, if necessary. When satisfactory relief of symptoms is achieved, it can usually be maintained with tablets. Not Recommended for Subcutaneous Administration. Special Directions for Use in Tetanus There is clinical evidence which suggests that methocarbamol may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular manifestations of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the usual procedure of debridement, tetanus antitoxin, penicillin, tracheotomy, attention to fluid balance, and supportive care. Methocarbamol injection should be added to the regimen as soon as possible. For Adults Inject one or two vials directly into the tubing of the previously inserted indwelling needle. An additional 10 mL or 20 mL may be added to the infusion bottle so that a total of up to 30 mL (three vials) is given as the initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). This procedure should be repeated every six hours until conditions allow for the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Crushed methocarbamol tablets suspended in water or saline may then be given through this tube. Total daily oral doses up to 24 grams may be required as judged by patient response. For Pediatric Patients A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg or 500 mg/m 2 is recommended. This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required. The total dose should not exceed 1.8 g/m 2 for 3 consecutive days. The maintenance dosage may be given by injection into tubing or by I.V. infusion with an appropriate quantity of fluid. See directions for I.V. use."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine."

Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

Drug & OR Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects -Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methocarbamol tablets USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Safe use of methocarbamol tablets USP has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol tablets USP should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards ( see WARNINGS). Nursing Mothers Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when methocarbamol tablets USP are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of methocarbamol tablets USP in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving methocarbamol tablets should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of methocarbamol has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, methocarbamol tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see PRECAUTIONS, PREGNANCY). Use in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery. Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 69 [\u00b1 4] years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean [\u00b1 SD] age, 53.3 [\u00b1 8.8] years), healthy population (1.5 [\u00b1 0.4] hours versus 1.1 [\u00b10.27] hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41% to 43% versus 46% to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40% to 45% compared to 46% to 50% in the normal subjects."

Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special Populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine. Special populations Elderly The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 69 (\u00b1 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger (mean (\u00b1 SD) age, 53.3 (\u00b1 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (\u00b1 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (\u00b10.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively). Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (\u00b1 0.6) versus 1.1 (\u00b10.3) hours, respectively. Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (\u00b1 1.62) hours and 1.11 (\u00b1 0.27) hours, respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects."
