      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Existing Pregnancy: ella is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. ( 5.1) Ectopic pregnancy: Evaluate women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella for ectopic pregnancy. ( 5.2 ) Fertility Following Use : Rapid return of fertility is likely. Subsequent acts of intercourse should be protected by a reliable barrier method of contraception until the next menstrual period. ( 5.5 ) Effect on Menstrual Cycle: ella may alter the next expected menses. If menses is delayed beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy. ( 5.6 ) Ella does not protect against STI/HIV. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Existing Pregnancy Ella is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. 5.2 Ectopic Pregnancy A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method. Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella . A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella . 5.3 Repeated Use Ella is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of ella within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated. 5.4 CYP3A4 Inducers A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, decreases the plasma concentration of ella significantly. Ella should not be administered with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.5 Fertility Following Use A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ella for emergency contraception. After use of ella , a reliable barrier method of contraception should be used with subsequent acts of intercourse until the next menstrual period. After using ella , if a woman wishes to initiate hormonal contraception as a regular method, she can do so, no sooner than 5 days after the intake of ella and she should use a reliable barrier method until the next menstrual period [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1 and 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Progestin-containing contraceptives may impair the ability of ella to delay ovulation. Advise women to follow the instructions on the initiation or resumption of hormonal contraceptives after ella intake [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) ]. 5.6 Effect on Menstrual Cycle After ella intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. Seven percent of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy. Nine percent of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after use of ella . 5.7 Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV Ella does not protect against HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."

Ella was studied in an open-label multicenter trial (Open-Label Study) and in a comparative, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial (Single-Blind Comparative Study). In these studies, a total of 2,637 (1,533 + 1,104) women in the 30 mg ulipristal acetate groups were included in the safety analysis. The mean age of women who received ulipristal acetate was 24.5 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.3. The racial demographics of those enrolled were 67% Caucasian, 20% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 12% other. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) in the clinical trials for women receiving ella were headache (18% overall), nausea (12% overall) and abdominal and upper abdominal pain (12% overall).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Ella is contraindicated for use during an existing or suspected pregnancy. No signal of concern regarding pregnancy complications was found in postmarketing studies [see Data ]. Isolated cases of major malformations in ella- exposed pregnancies were identified; however, the data are not sufficient to determine a risk for birth defects with inadvertent use of ella during pregnancy. Miscarriage was reported in 14% of the known pregnancy outcomes; a rate that is similar to the U.S. background rate for miscarriage. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed during repeated administration of ulipristal acetate to pregnant rats, rabbits and monkeys at daily drug exposures \u2153, \u00bd, and 3 times respectively, the human exposure at a dose of 30 mg [ see Data ] . Data Human Data Ella pregnancy exposure data was collected in the U.S. and Europe from 1999 to 2015 and analyzed post-marketing using data from interventional clinical trials, observational studies and pharmacovigilance reports. Known pregnancy outcomes were available for 462/784 pregnancies in which women received ella at doses of 30 mg or greater during the conception cycle or during pregnancy. Data of pregnancies with known outcome were analyzed prospectively for 272 cases and retrospectively for 190 cases. Pregnancy outcomes included 302 elective abortions (2 for fetal anomalies including 1 with trisomy 21), 63 spontaneous abortions, and 13 ectopic pregnancies. No maternal or fetal deaths were reported. 84 pregnancies continued until birth, with congenital anomalies reported in 5 infants, including 4 major malformations (2/4 with genetic syndromes). Although these data do not allow estimation of the prevalence rate of congenital anomalies associated with inadvertent use of ella in pregnancy or determination of a causal relationship between reported anomalies and ella , they show that ella -exposed pregnancies were not associated with a pattern of increased risk of adverse outcomes. Animal Data Ulipristal acetate was administered repeatedly to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal loss was noted in all pregnant rats and in half of the pregnant rabbits following 12 and 13 days of dosing, at daily drug exposures 1/3 and 1/2 the human exposure, respectively, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). There were no malformations of the surviving fetuses in these studies. Adverse effects were not observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered ulipristal acetate during the period of organogenesis through lactation at drug exposures 1/24 the human exposure based on AUC. Administration of ulipristal acetate to pregnant monkeys for 4 days during the first trimester caused pregnancy termination in 2/5 animals at daily drug exposures 3 times the human exposure based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Ulipristal acetate and its active metabolite, monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate, are present in human milk in small amounts (see Data ). Based on the levels of drug and active metabolite measured in breastmilk, a fully breastfed child would receive a weight-adjusted dosage of approximately 0.8% of ulipristal acetate and monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate on Day 1 of drug administration and an approximate total of 1% of the maternal dose over a 5-day period after drug administration. There is no information on the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ella and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ella or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of 12 lactating women following administration of ella was collected in 24-hour increments to measure the concentrations of ulipristal acetate and the active metabolite monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate in breast milk. The mean daily concentrations of ulipristal acetate in breast milk were 22.7 ng/mL [0-24 hours], 2.96 ng/mL [24-48 hours], 1.56 ng/mL [48-72 hours], 1.04 ng/mL [72-96 hours], and 0.69 ng/mL [96-120 hours]. The mean daily concentrations of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate in breast milk were 4.49 ng/mL [0-24 hours], 0.62 ng/mL [24-48 hours], 0.28 ng/mL [48-72 hours], 0.17 ng/mL [72-96 hours], and 0.10 ng/mL [96-120 hours]. Using these data, a fully breastfed infant would receive approximately 4.1 mcg/kg of ulipristal acetate and monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate on Day 1 following drug administration and approximately 5.2 mcg/kg over a five day period following drug administration. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Progestin-containing contraceptives may impair the ability of ella to delay ovulation. Advise females to use a reliable barrier method for subsequent acts of intercourse until her next menstrual period. After using ella , if a woman wishes to initiate or resume hormonal contraception, she can do so, no sooner than 5 days after the intake of ella and she should use a reliable barrier method of contraception until the next menstrual period. If a woman used ella due to a known or suspected failure of her hormonal contraception refer to the hormonal contraceptive\u2019s prescribing information for instructions on what to do [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There is no relevant use of ulipristal acetate for children of prepubertal age in the indication emergency contraception . Adolescents: Safety and efficacy of ella have been established in women of reproductive age. The clinical trials of ella enrolled 41 females under age 18, and a post-marketing observational study evaluating effectiveness and safety of ella in adolescents enrolled 279 females under age 18, including 76 under age 16 years. In these studies, the safety and efficacy profile observed in adolescents aged 17 and younger was similar to that in adults. Use of ella before menarche is not indicated. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product is not intended for use in postmenopausal women. 8.6 Race While no formal studies have evaluated the effect of race, a cross-study comparison of two pharmacokinetic studies indicated that exposure in South Asians may exceed that in Caucasians and African Americans. However, no difference in efficacy and safety was observed for women of different races in clinical studies. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of ella . 8.8 Renal Impairment No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of ella ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor. The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depend on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration. Pharmacodynamic data showed that administration of ella to 34 women in the late follicular phase postponed follicular rupture for at least 5 days in all (100%) of 8 subjects who took ella before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and 11 (79%) of 14 subjects who took ella immediately before ovulation (when LH has already started to rise). However, treatment was not effective in postponing follicular rupture when administered on the day of LH peak. Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 \u00b1 2.2 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). Hormonal Contraceptives after ella intake: In women initiating hormonal contraception (quickstart scenario) : When a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started the day after ella intake during the follicular phase, ella did not interfere with the COC\u2019s ability to suppress ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound, combined with serum progesterone and estradiol levels: ovarian activity was suppressed in 61.5% (24/39) of subjects receiving ella plus COC and 62.2% (23/37) of subjects receiving a placebo plus the COC. The incidence of ovulation was similar between the group that received ella plus the COC [33.3% (13/39)] and the group that received a placebo plus the COC [32.4% (12/37)]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . The initiation of a desogestrel 75 \u00b5g progestin-only pill (POP) the day after ella intake during the follicular phase was associated with a higher incidence of ovulation in the six days following ella intake compared to an ella -only treatment group, and a relatively slower onset (3 to 4 days) of thickened cervical mucus compared to a group given desogestrel without prior ella intake (2 days), suggesting an effect of prior use of ella on the ability of desogestrel to inhibit mucus permeability. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 ; 7.3 )] . When a COC containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started 2 days after ella intake, ella 's ability to delay ovulation, as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound, was reduced: follicular rupture occurred in 9/33 subjects (27%) in less than 5 days, compared to 1/33 subjects after ella alone (3%). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In women resuming combined hormonal contraception (missed pills scenario): The effects on ovarian activity of delaying versus immediately resuming COCs after ella intake were investigated in 49 women who had been using COCs containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo pills for at least one cycle. All subjects missed three consecutive pills (Days 5-7) during the first week of pills in the subsequent cycle and took ella on the following day (Day 8). These subjects were randomized to resume their COCs either on the same day as ella intake versus five days later. No ovulations with potential risk of pregnancy occurred in either group in the five days following ella intake. However, in the group that waited five days to resume taking COCs, 4/23 (17.4%) women did ovulate later in the cycle (Days 18-26) whereas no ovulations (0/26) occurred in the group that resumed COC intake on the same day as ella intake. Whether similar results can be expected with other COC products containing different progestins or missed active pills during different weeks in a treatment cycle is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single dose administration of ella in 20 women under fasting conditions, maximum plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate and the active metabolite, monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate, were 176 and 69 ng/ml and were reached at 0.9 and 1 hour, respectively.

These differences are not expected to impair the efficacy or safety of ella to a clinically significant extent; therefore, ella can be taken with or without food. Distribution Ulipristal acetate is highly bound (> 94%) to plasma proteins, including high density lipoprotein, alpha-l-acid glycoprotein, and albumin. Metabolism Ulipristal acetate is metabolized to mono-demethylated and di-demethylated metabolites. In vitro data indicate that this is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4. The mono-demethylated metabolite is pharmacologically active. Excretion The terminal half-life of ulipristal acetate in plasma following a single 30 mg dose is estimated to be 32.4 \u00b1 6.3 hours. Drug interactions CYP3A4 inducers: When a single 30 mg dose of ulipristal acetate was administered following administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin 600 mg once daily for 9 days, C max and AUC of ulipristal acetate decreased by 90% and 93% respectively. The C max and AUC of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate decreased by 84% and 90% respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 inhibitors: When a single 10 mg dose of ulipristal acetate was administered following administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days, C max and AUC of ulipristal acetate increased by 2- and 5.9- fold, respectively. While the AUC of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate increased by 2.4-fold, C max of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate decreased by 47%. There was no in vivo drug-drug interaction study between ulipristal acetate 30 mg and CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In vitro studies demonstrated that ella does not induce or inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter: In vitro data indicate that ulipristal may be an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations. When a single 60 mg dose of fexofenadine, a substrate of P-gp glycoprotein, was administered 1.5 hours after the administration of a single 10 mg dose of ulipristal acetate, there was no increase in C max or AUC of fexofenadine. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) transporter: In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of BCRP at the intestinal level. The effects of ella on P-gp and BCRP transporters are unlikely to have any clinical consequences when considering ella 's single dose treatment regimen, although there was no in vivo drug interaction study between ulipristal acetate 30 mg ( ella ) and substrates of P-pg and BCRP transporters.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor. The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depend on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration. Pharmacodynamic data showed that administration of ella to 34 women in the late follicular phase postponed follicular rupture for at least 5 days in all (100%) of 8 subjects who took ella before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and 11 (79%) of 14 subjects who took ella immediately before ovulation (when LH has already started to rise). However, treatment was not effective in postponing follicular rupture when administered on the day of LH peak. Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 \u00b1 2.2 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). Hormonal Contraceptives after ella intake: In women initiating hormonal contraception (quickstart scenario) : When a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started the day after ella intake during the follicular phase, ella did not interfere with the COC\u2019s ability to suppress ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound, combined with serum progesterone and estradiol levels: ovarian activity was suppressed in 61.5% (24/39) of subjects receiving ella plus COC and 62.2% (23/37) of subjects receiving a placebo plus the COC. The incidence of ovulation was similar between the group that received ella plus the COC [33.3% (13/39)] and the group that received a placebo plus the COC [32.4% (12/37)]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . The initiation of a desogestrel 75 \u00b5g progestin-only pill (POP) the day after ella intake during the follicular phase was associated with a higher incidence of ovulation in the six days following ella intake compared to an ella -only treatment group, and a relatively slower onset (3 to 4 days) of thickened cervical mucus compared to a group given desogestrel without prior ella intake (2 days), suggesting an effect of prior use of ella on the ability of desogestrel to inhibit mucus permeability. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 ; 7.3 )] . When a COC containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started 2 days after ella intake, ella 's ability to delay ovulation, as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound, was reduced: follicular rupture occurred in 9/33 subjects (27%) in less than 5 days, compared to 1/33 subjects after ella alone (3%). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In women resuming combined hormonal contraception (missed pills scenario): The effects on ovarian activity of delaying versus immediately resuming COCs after ella intake were investigated in 49 women who had been using COCs containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo pills for at least one cycle. All subjects missed three consecutive pills (Days 5-7) during the first week of pills in the subsequent cycle and took ella on the following day (Day 8). These subjects were randomized to resume their COCs either on the same day as ella intake versus five days later. No ovulations with potential risk of pregnancy occurred in either group in the five days following ella intake. However, in the group that waited five days to resume taking COCs, 4/23 (17.4%) women did ovulate later in the cycle (Days 18-26) whereas no ovulations (0/26) occurred in the group that resumed COC intake on the same day as ella intake. Whether similar results can be expected with other COC products containing different progestins or missed active pills during different weeks in a treatment cycle is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two multicenter clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of ella . An open-label study provided the primary data to support the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. A single-blind comparative study provided the primary data to support the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken 0 to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and provided supportive data for ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken > 72 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Women in both studies were required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to receiving emergency contraception. The primary efficacy analyses were performed on subjects less than 36 years of age who had a known pregnancy status after taking study medication. Table 3: Summary of Clinical Trial Results for Women Who Received a Single Dose of ella (30 mg Ulipristal Acetate) Open-Label Study 48 to 120 Hours * Single-Blind Comparative Study 0 to 72 Hours * N = 1,242 N = 844 Expected Pregnancy Rate ** 5.5 5.6 Observed Pregnancy Rate ** (95% confidence interval) 2.2 (1.5, 3.2) 1.9 (1.1, 3.1) * Time after unprotected intercourse when ella was taken ** Number of pregnancies per 100 women at risk for pregnancy 14.1 Open-Label Study This study was a multicenter open-label trial conducted at 40 family planning clinics in the United States. Healthy women with a mean age of 24 years who requested emergency contraception 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse received a dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate ( ella ). The median BMI for the study subjects was 25.3 and ranged from 16.1 to 61.3 kg/m 2 . Twenty-seven pregnancies occurred in 1,242 women aged 18 to 35 years evaluated for efficacy. The number of pregnancies expected without emergency contraception was calculated based on the timing of intercourse with regard to each woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. Ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected rate of 5.5% to an observed rate of 2.2%, when taken 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. 14.2 Single-Blind Comparative Study This study was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized comparison of the efficacy and safety of 30 mg ulipristal acetate ( ella ) to levonorgestrel (another form of emergency contraception). Subjects were enrolled at 35 sites in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the majority (66%) having been enrolled in the U.S. Healthy women with a mean age of 25 years who requested emergency contraception within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive ella or levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. The median BMI for the study subjects was 25.3 and ranged from 14.9 to 70.0 kg/m 2 . In the ella group, 16 pregnancies occurred in 844 women aged 16 to 35 years when emergency contraception was taken 0 to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. The number of pregnancies expected without emergency contraception was calculated based on the timing of intercourse with regard to each woman's menstrual cycle; ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected 5.6% to an observed 1.9%, when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. There were no pregnancies observed in the women who were administered ella more than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse (10% of women who received ella ). 14.3 Pooled Analysis Data from the two studies were pooled to provide a total efficacy population of women treated with ulipristal acetate up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Time Trend analysis for the five 24-hour intervals from 0 to 120 hours between unprotected intercourse and treatment was conducted. There were no significant differences in the observed pregnancy rates across the five time intervals. Subgroup analysis of the pooled data by BMI showed that for women with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 (16% of all subjects), the observed pregnancy rate was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.7, 5.7), which was not significantly reduced compared to the expected pregnancy rate of 4.5% in the absence of emergency contraception taken within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. In the comparative study, a similar effect was seen for the comparator emergency contraception drug, levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. For levonorgestrel, when used by women with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 , the observed pregnancy rate was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.9, 13.4), compared to the expected pregnancy rate of 4.4% in the absence of emergency contraception taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Existing Pregnancy: ella is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. ( 5.1) Ectopic pregnancy: Evaluate women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella for ectopic pregnancy. ( 5.2 ) Fertility Following Use : Rapid return of fertility is likely. Subsequent acts of intercourse should be protected by a reliable barrier method of contraception until the next menstrual period. ( 5.5 ) Effect on Menstrual Cycle: ella may alter the next expected menses. If menses is delayed beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy. ( 5.6 ) Ella does not protect against STI/HIV. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Existing Pregnancy Ella is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. 5.2 Ectopic Pregnancy A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method. Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella . A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella . 5.3 Repeated Use Ella is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of ella within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated. 5.4 CYP3A4 Inducers A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, decreases the plasma concentration of ella significantly. Ella should not be administered with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.5 Fertility Following Use A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ella for emergency contraception. After use of ella , a reliable barrier method of contraception should be used with subsequent acts of intercourse until the next menstrual period. After using ella , if a woman wishes to initiate hormonal contraception as a regular method, she can do so, no sooner than 5 days after the intake of ella and she should use a reliable barrier method until the next menstrual period [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1 and 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Progestin-containing contraceptives may impair the ability of ella to delay ovulation. Advise women to follow the instructions on the initiation or resumption of hormonal contraceptives after ella intake [see Dosage and Administration(2.2) ]. 5.6 Effect on Menstrual Cycle After ella intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. Seven percent of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy. Nine percent of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after use of ella . 5.7 Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV Ella does not protect against HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."

Ella was studied in an open-label multicenter trial (Open-Label Study) and in a comparative, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial (Single-Blind Comparative Study). In these studies, a total of 2,637 (1,533 + 1,104) women in the 30 mg ulipristal acetate groups were included in the safety analysis. The mean age of women who received ulipristal acetate was 24.5 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.3. The racial demographics of those enrolled were 67% Caucasian, 20% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 12% other. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) in the clinical trials for women receiving ella were headache (18% overall), nausea (12% overall) and abdominal and upper abdominal pain (12% overall).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Ella is contraindicated for use during an existing or suspected pregnancy. No signal of concern regarding pregnancy complications was found in postmarketing studies [see Data ]. Isolated cases of major malformations in ella- exposed pregnancies were identified; however, the data are not sufficient to determine a risk for birth defects with inadvertent use of ella during pregnancy. Miscarriage was reported in 14% of the known pregnancy outcomes; a rate that is similar to the U.S. background rate for miscarriage. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed during repeated administration of ulipristal acetate to pregnant rats, rabbits and monkeys at daily drug exposures \u2153, \u00bd, and 3 times respectively, the human exposure at a dose of 30 mg [ see Data ] . Data Human Data Ella pregnancy exposure data was collected in the U.S. and Europe from 1999 to 2015 and analyzed post-marketing using data from interventional clinical trials, observational studies and pharmacovigilance reports. Known pregnancy outcomes were available for 462/784 pregnancies in which women received ella at doses of 30 mg or greater during the conception cycle or during pregnancy. Data of pregnancies with known outcome were analyzed prospectively for 272 cases and retrospectively for 190 cases. Pregnancy outcomes included 302 elective abortions (2 for fetal anomalies including 1 with trisomy 21), 63 spontaneous abortions, and 13 ectopic pregnancies. No maternal or fetal deaths were reported. 84 pregnancies continued until birth, with congenital anomalies reported in 5 infants, including 4 major malformations (2/4 with genetic syndromes). Although these data do not allow estimation of the prevalence rate of congenital anomalies associated with inadvertent use of ella in pregnancy or determination of a causal relationship between reported anomalies and ella , they show that ella -exposed pregnancies were not associated with a pattern of increased risk of adverse outcomes. Animal Data Ulipristal acetate was administered repeatedly to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal loss was noted in all pregnant rats and in half of the pregnant rabbits following 12 and 13 days of dosing, at daily drug exposures 1/3 and 1/2 the human exposure, respectively, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). There were no malformations of the surviving fetuses in these studies. Adverse effects were not observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered ulipristal acetate during the period of organogenesis through lactation at drug exposures 1/24 the human exposure based on AUC. Administration of ulipristal acetate to pregnant monkeys for 4 days during the first trimester caused pregnancy termination in 2/5 animals at daily drug exposures 3 times the human exposure based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Ulipristal acetate and its active metabolite, monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate, are present in human milk in small amounts (see Data ). Based on the levels of drug and active metabolite measured in breastmilk, a fully breastfed child would receive a weight-adjusted dosage of approximately 0.8% of ulipristal acetate and monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate on Day 1 of drug administration and an approximate total of 1% of the maternal dose over a 5-day period after drug administration. There is no information on the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ella and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ella or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of 12 lactating women following administration of ella was collected in 24-hour increments to measure the concentrations of ulipristal acetate and the active metabolite monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate in breast milk. The mean daily concentrations of ulipristal acetate in breast milk were 22.7 ng/mL [0-24 hours], 2.96 ng/mL [24-48 hours], 1.56 ng/mL [48-72 hours], 1.04 ng/mL [72-96 hours], and 0.69 ng/mL [96-120 hours]. The mean daily concentrations of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate in breast milk were 4.49 ng/mL [0-24 hours], 0.62 ng/mL [24-48 hours], 0.28 ng/mL [48-72 hours], 0.17 ng/mL [72-96 hours], and 0.10 ng/mL [96-120 hours]. Using these data, a fully breastfed infant would receive approximately 4.1 mcg/kg of ulipristal acetate and monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate on Day 1 following drug administration and approximately 5.2 mcg/kg over a five day period following drug administration. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Progestin-containing contraceptives may impair the ability of ella to delay ovulation. Advise females to use a reliable barrier method for subsequent acts of intercourse until her next menstrual period. After using ella , if a woman wishes to initiate or resume hormonal contraception, she can do so, no sooner than 5 days after the intake of ella and she should use a reliable barrier method of contraception until the next menstrual period. If a woman used ella due to a known or suspected failure of her hormonal contraception refer to the hormonal contraceptive\u2019s prescribing information for instructions on what to do [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There is no relevant use of ulipristal acetate for children of prepubertal age in the indication emergency contraception . Adolescents: Safety and efficacy of ella have been established in women of reproductive age. The clinical trials of ella enrolled 41 females under age 18, and a post-marketing observational study evaluating effectiveness and safety of ella in adolescents enrolled 279 females under age 18, including 76 under age 16 years. In these studies, the safety and efficacy profile observed in adolescents aged 17 and younger was similar to that in adults. Use of ella before menarche is not indicated. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product is not intended for use in postmenopausal women. 8.6 Race While no formal studies have evaluated the effect of race, a cross-study comparison of two pharmacokinetic studies indicated that exposure in South Asians may exceed that in Caucasians and African Americans. However, no difference in efficacy and safety was observed for women of different races in clinical studies. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of ella . 8.8 Renal Impairment No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of ella ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor. The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depend on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration. Pharmacodynamic data showed that administration of ella to 34 women in the late follicular phase postponed follicular rupture for at least 5 days in all (100%) of 8 subjects who took ella before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and 11 (79%) of 14 subjects who took ella immediately before ovulation (when LH has already started to rise). However, treatment was not effective in postponing follicular rupture when administered on the day of LH peak. Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 \u00b1 2.2 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). Hormonal Contraceptives after ella intake: In women initiating hormonal contraception (quickstart scenario) : When a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started the day after ella intake during the follicular phase, ella did not interfere with the COC\u2019s ability to suppress ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound, combined with serum progesterone and estradiol levels: ovarian activity was suppressed in 61.5% (24/39) of subjects receiving ella plus COC and 62.2% (23/37) of subjects receiving a placebo plus the COC. The incidence of ovulation was similar between the group that received ella plus the COC [33.3% (13/39)] and the group that received a placebo plus the COC [32.4% (12/37)]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . The initiation of a desogestrel 75 \u00b5g progestin-only pill (POP) the day after ella intake during the follicular phase was associated with a higher incidence of ovulation in the six days following ella intake compared to an ella -only treatment group, and a relatively slower onset (3 to 4 days) of thickened cervical mucus compared to a group given desogestrel without prior ella intake (2 days), suggesting an effect of prior use of ella on the ability of desogestrel to inhibit mucus permeability. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 ; 7.3 )] . When a COC containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started 2 days after ella intake, ella 's ability to delay ovulation, as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound, was reduced: follicular rupture occurred in 9/33 subjects (27%) in less than 5 days, compared to 1/33 subjects after ella alone (3%). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In women resuming combined hormonal contraception (missed pills scenario): The effects on ovarian activity of delaying versus immediately resuming COCs after ella intake were investigated in 49 women who had been using COCs containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo pills for at least one cycle. All subjects missed three consecutive pills (Days 5-7) during the first week of pills in the subsequent cycle and took ella on the following day (Day 8). These subjects were randomized to resume their COCs either on the same day as ella intake versus five days later. No ovulations with potential risk of pregnancy occurred in either group in the five days following ella intake. However, in the group that waited five days to resume taking COCs, 4/23 (17.4%) women did ovulate later in the cycle (Days 18-26) whereas no ovulations (0/26) occurred in the group that resumed COC intake on the same day as ella intake. Whether similar results can be expected with other COC products containing different progestins or missed active pills during different weeks in a treatment cycle is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single dose administration of ella in 20 women under fasting conditions, maximum plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate and the active metabolite, monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate, were 176 and 69 ng/ml and were reached at 0.9 and 1 hour, respectively.

These differences are not expected to impair the efficacy or safety of ella to a clinically significant extent; therefore, ella can be taken with or without food. Distribution Ulipristal acetate is highly bound (> 94%) to plasma proteins, including high density lipoprotein, alpha-l-acid glycoprotein, and albumin. Metabolism Ulipristal acetate is metabolized to mono-demethylated and di-demethylated metabolites. In vitro data indicate that this is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4. The mono-demethylated metabolite is pharmacologically active. Excretion The terminal half-life of ulipristal acetate in plasma following a single 30 mg dose is estimated to be 32.4 \u00b1 6.3 hours. Drug interactions CYP3A4 inducers: When a single 30 mg dose of ulipristal acetate was administered following administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin 600 mg once daily for 9 days, C max and AUC of ulipristal acetate decreased by 90% and 93% respectively. The C max and AUC of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate decreased by 84% and 90% respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A4 inhibitors: When a single 10 mg dose of ulipristal acetate was administered following administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days, C max and AUC of ulipristal acetate increased by 2- and 5.9- fold, respectively. While the AUC of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate increased by 2.4-fold, C max of monodemethyl-ulipristal acetate decreased by 47%. There was no in vivo drug-drug interaction study between ulipristal acetate 30 mg and CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In vitro studies demonstrated that ella does not induce or inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter: In vitro data indicate that ulipristal may be an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations. When a single 60 mg dose of fexofenadine, a substrate of P-gp glycoprotein, was administered 1.5 hours after the administration of a single 10 mg dose of ulipristal acetate, there was no increase in C max or AUC of fexofenadine. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) transporter: In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of BCRP at the intestinal level. The effects of ella on P-gp and BCRP transporters are unlikely to have any clinical consequences when considering ella 's single dose treatment regimen, although there was no in vivo drug interaction study between ulipristal acetate 30 mg ( ella ) and substrates of P-pg and BCRP transporters."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor. The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depend on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration. Pharmacodynamic data showed that administration of ella to 34 women in the late follicular phase postponed follicular rupture for at least 5 days in all (100%) of 8 subjects who took ella before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and 11 (79%) of 14 subjects who took ella immediately before ovulation (when LH has already started to rise). However, treatment was not effective in postponing follicular rupture when administered on the day of LH peak. Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 \u00b1 2.2 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). Hormonal Contraceptives after ella intake: In women initiating hormonal contraception (quickstart scenario) : When a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started the day after ella intake during the follicular phase, ella did not interfere with the COC\u2019s ability to suppress ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound, combined with serum progesterone and estradiol levels: ovarian activity was suppressed in 61.5% (24/39) of subjects receiving ella plus COC and 62.2% (23/37) of subjects receiving a placebo plus the COC. The incidence of ovulation was similar between the group that received ella plus the COC [33.3% (13/39)] and the group that received a placebo plus the COC [32.4% (12/37)]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . The initiation of a desogestrel 75 \u00b5g progestin-only pill (POP) the day after ella intake during the follicular phase was associated with a higher incidence of ovulation in the six days following ella intake compared to an ella -only treatment group, and a relatively slower onset (3 to 4 days) of thickened cervical mucus compared to a group given desogestrel without prior ella intake (2 days), suggesting an effect of prior use of ella on the ability of desogestrel to inhibit mucus permeability. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1 ; 7.3 )] . When a COC containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g was started 2 days after ella intake, ella 's ability to delay ovulation, as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound, was reduced: follicular rupture occurred in 9/33 subjects (27%) in less than 5 days, compared to 1/33 subjects after ella alone (3%). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In women resuming combined hormonal contraception (missed pills scenario): The effects on ovarian activity of delaying versus immediately resuming COCs after ella intake were investigated in 49 women who had been using COCs containing ethinyl estradiol 30 \u00b5g + levonorgestrel 150 \u00b5g once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo pills for at least one cycle. All subjects missed three consecutive pills (Days 5-7) during the first week of pills in the subsequent cycle and took ella on the following day (Day 8). These subjects were randomized to resume their COCs either on the same day as ella intake versus five days later. No ovulations with potential risk of pregnancy occurred in either group in the five days following ella intake. However, in the group that waited five days to resume taking COCs, 4/23 (17.4%) women did ovulate later in the cycle (Days 18-26) whereas no ovulations (0/26) occurred in the group that resumed COC intake on the same day as ella intake. Whether similar results can be expected with other COC products containing different progestins or missed active pills during different weeks in a treatment cycle is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two multicenter clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of ella . An open-label study provided the primary data to support the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. A single-blind comparative study provided the primary data to support the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken 0 to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and provided supportive data for ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception when taken > 72 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Women in both studies were required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to receiving emergency contraception. The primary efficacy analyses were performed on subjects less than 36 years of age who had a known pregnancy status after taking study medication. Table 3: Summary of Clinical Trial Results for Women Who Received a Single Dose of ella (30 mg Ulipristal Acetate) Open-Label Study 48 to 120 Hours * Single-Blind Comparative Study 0 to 72 Hours * N = 1,242 N = 844 Expected Pregnancy Rate ** 5.5 5.6 Observed Pregnancy Rate ** (95% confidence interval) 2.2 (1.5, 3.2) 1.9 (1.1, 3.1) * Time after unprotected intercourse when ella was taken ** Number of pregnancies per 100 women at risk for pregnancy 14.1 Open-Label Study This study was a multicenter open-label trial conducted at 40 family planning clinics in the United States. Healthy women with a mean age of 24 years who requested emergency contraception 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse received a dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate ( ella ). The median BMI for the study subjects was 25.3 and ranged from 16.1 to 61.3 kg/m 2 . Twenty-seven pregnancies occurred in 1,242 women aged 18 to 35 years evaluated for efficacy. The number of pregnancies expected without emergency contraception was calculated based on the timing of intercourse with regard to each woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. Ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected rate of 5.5% to an observed rate of 2.2%, when taken 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. 14.2 Single-Blind Comparative Study This study was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized comparison of the efficacy and safety of 30 mg ulipristal acetate ( ella ) to levonorgestrel (another form of emergency contraception). Subjects were enrolled at 35 sites in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the majority (66%) having been enrolled in the U.S. Healthy women with a mean age of 25 years who requested emergency contraception within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive ella or levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. The median BMI for the study subjects was 25.3 and ranged from 14.9 to 70.0 kg/m 2 . In the ella group, 16 pregnancies occurred in 844 women aged 16 to 35 years when emergency contraception was taken 0 to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. The number of pregnancies expected without emergency contraception was calculated based on the timing of intercourse with regard to each woman's menstrual cycle; ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected 5.6% to an observed 1.9%, when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. There were no pregnancies observed in the women who were administered ella more than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse (10% of women who received ella ). 14.3 Pooled Analysis Data from the two studies were pooled to provide a total efficacy population of women treated with ulipristal acetate up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Time Trend analysis for the five 24-hour intervals from 0 to 120 hours between unprotected intercourse and treatment was conducted. There were no significant differences in the observed pregnancy rates across the five time intervals. Subgroup analysis of the pooled data by BMI showed that for women with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 (16% of all subjects), the observed pregnancy rate was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.7, 5.7), which was not significantly reduced compared to the expected pregnancy rate of 4.5% in the absence of emergency contraception taken within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. In the comparative study, a similar effect was seen for the comparator emergency contraception drug, levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. For levonorgestrel, when used by women with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 , the observed pregnancy rate was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.9, 13.4), compared to the expected pregnancy rate of 4.4% in the absence of emergency contraception taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse."
