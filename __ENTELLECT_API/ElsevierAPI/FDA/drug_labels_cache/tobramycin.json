      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin Injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 40 mg tobramycin; sodium metabisulfite added as an antioxidant, 3.2 mg; and edetate disodium added as a stabilizer, 0.1 mg. Contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. pH 4.0 (3.0 to 6.5). Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy- \u03b1 -D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). tobramycin-spl-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Test: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin injection is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains) Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacte r sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tobramycin Injection and other antimicrobial drugs, Tobramycin Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin 40 mg/mL in 50 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package vial contains 39.3 mg (1.70 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients \u2014Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When and antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity \u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms\u2014 The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment\u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient\u2019s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function\u2014 Adults with Serious Infections : 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ).

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less : Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration \u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR EYE USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to one or two drops every two (2) hours. Frequency should be decreased gradually as warranted by improvement in clinical signs. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. Not more than 20 mL should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in PRECAUTIONS above."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosage Tobramycin inhalation solution is for oral inhalation only [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The recommended dosage of tobramycin inhalation solution for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is one single-dose ampule (300 mg) administered twice daily for 28 days. Dosage is not adjusted by weight. All patients should be administered 300 mg twice daily. Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered twice daily in alternating periods of 28 days. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on/28 day off cycle. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible; they should not be taken less than 6 hours apart. If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15-minute period, using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration. Prior to administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for tobramycin inhalation solution for detailed information on how to use tobramycin inhalation solution, and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth. Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications, prior to inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by their physician. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs.(5.1) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.3) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. (5.4) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm (5.5,8.1) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients with Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients * Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n = 258) % Placebo (n = 262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased * 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.

In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change from Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change from Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

      "Instructions for Use Tobramycin (toe-bra-MYE-sin) Inhalation Solution for oral inhalation use Read this Instructions for Use before you start using tobramycin inhalation solution and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A): 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E). (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F). (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G). The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H) . (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure I) . Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12 : Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure J) . (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup. (See Figure K). (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure L) . (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure M). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O) . (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \u201cOff\u201d position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor.

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNINGS Patients treated with tobramycin injection and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin injection should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "DESCRIPTION: Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin Injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Tobramycin sulfate is O- 3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O- [2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5) (salt). The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u20225H 2 SO 4 M.W. 1425.45 Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 40 mg tobramycin; phenol 5 mg; sodium metabisulfite 3.2 mg; 0.1 mg edetate disodium and water for injection, q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust the pH (3.0 to 6.5). Each mL of tobramycin contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium. structure"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Resistance Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci. Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Interactions with Other Antibacterial Drugs In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis. However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium. Species-level identification of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism must be performed. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in INDICATIONS AND USAGE section (1): Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter species Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia species Serratia species Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci. For Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., aminoglycosides may appear active in vitro but are not effective clinically and should not be reported as susceptible. Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antibacterial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method 1,3 . Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 1. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antibacterial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations and paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of tobramycin 2,3 . The disk diffusion values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1.

A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tobramycin Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Tobramycin Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Tobramycin injection is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the pediatric patient and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella spp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginos a, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains) Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella spp, and Enterobacter spp Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus spp, E. coli , Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus spp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, S. aureus , Providencia spp, and Citrobacter spp Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: See WARNINGS box above. Tobramycin injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

      "PRECAUTIONS: General Prescribing tobramycin injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less susceptible organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tobramycin injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Pregnancy Category D Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (AST, ALT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.",

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE: Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, in pediatric patients given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or in patients with reduced renal function where dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdose, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patients. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients who have received an overdose of tobramycin and who have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial.",

Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults With Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated.

Pediatric Patients (greater than 1 week of age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals : When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. Normal dosage at prolonged intervals : If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. nomogram Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intramuscular Administration Tobramycin may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Prior to administration, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit.",
      "Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults With Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated.

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days.",
      "Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability.",
      "Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals : When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. Normal dosage at prolonged intervals : If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. nomogram",
      "Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg.",
      "Intramuscular Administration Tobramycin may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial.",
      "Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Prior to administration, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION One or two drops instilled into the conjunctival sac(s) every four to six hours. During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to one or two drops every two (2) hours. Frequency should be decreased gradually as warranted by improvement in clinical signs. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. Not more than 20 mL should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in PRECAUTIONS above."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with tobramycin, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose was similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin therapy during clinical studies, however in post-marketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A > G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in > 5% of tobramycin patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 5% of Tobramycin Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n = 258) % Placebo (n = 262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin administered by inhalation. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u2265 40 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin is not indicated in children < 6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. (1) The bioavailability of tobramycin may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. (1) The bioavailability of tobramycin may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of tobramycin has been completed. Rats were exposed to tobramycin for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. The clinical formulation of the drug was used for this carcinogenicity study. Serum levels of tobramycin of up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, in contrast to the average 1 mcg/mL levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor. Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with 5 tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test. Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of > 2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Regimen n = 258 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo Regimen n = 262 Placebo twice daily No drug Placebo twice daily No drug Placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b2 2 -agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, Tobramycin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265 128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u2265 16 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin regimen. 10 10"

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Tobramycin (toe\u201d bra mye\u2019 sin) Inhalation Solution for oral inhalation use What is tobramycin inhalation solution? Tobramycin inhalation solution is a prescription medicine that is used to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have a bacterial infection called Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Tobramycin inhalation solution contains an antibacterial medicine called tobramycin (an aminoglycoside). It is not known if tobramycin inhalation solution is safe and effective: in children under 6 years of age in people who have an FEV 1 less than 25% or greater than 75% predicted in people who are colonized with a bacterium called Burkholderia cepacia Do not take tobramycin inhalation solution if you are allergic to tobramycin, any of the ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution, or to any other aminoglycoside antibacterial. See the end of this Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution. Before you take tobramycin inhalation solution, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had hearing problems (including noises in your ears such as ringing or hissing), hearing loss, or your mother has had hearing problems after taking an aminoglycoside. have been told you have certain gene variants (a change in the gene) related to hearing abnormalities inherited from your mother. have dizziness have or have had kidney problems have or have had problems with muscle weakness such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease have or have had breathing problems such as wheezing, coughing, or chest tightness are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs that can harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if tobramycin passes into your breast milk. are receiving aminoglycoside therapy by injection or through a vein (intravenous) while taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Your blood levels of tobramycin will be checked. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How should I take tobramycin inhalation solution? See the step-by-step Instructions for Use about the right way to take your tobramycin inhalation solution. Take tobramycin inhalation solution exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Do not change your dose or stop taking tobramycin inhalation solution unless your healthcare provider tells you to. The usual dose for adults and children over 6 years of age is: 1 single-dose ampule of tobramycin inhalation solution inhaled 2 times each day using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor. Each dose of tobramycin inhalation solution should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible. You should not take your dose less than 6 hours apart. Tobramycin inhalation solution is taken as a breathing treatment (inhalation) with a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Do not use any other nebulizer for your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment. Do not mix or dilute tobramycin inhalation solution with dornase alfa or other medicines in your nebulizer system. Each treatment should take about 15 minutes. Tobramycin inhalation solution should be inhaled while you are sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help you to breathe through your mouth. If you forget to take tobramycin inhalation solution and there are at least 6 hours to your next dose, take your dose as soon as you can. Otherwise, wait for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for the missed dose. After using tobramycin inhalation solution for 28 days, you should stop using it and wait 28 days. After you have stopped using tobramycin inhalation solution for 28 days, you should start using tobramycin inhalation solution again for 28 days. Complete the full 28-day course even if you are feeling better. It is important that you keep to the 28-day on, 28-day off cycle. If you are taking several medicines or treatments to treat your cystic fibrosis, you should take your medicines or other treatments before inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by your healthcare provider. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using tobramycin inhalation solution with certain other medicines can cause serious side effects. If you are using tobramycin inhalation solution, you should discuss with your healthcare provider if you should take: other medicines that may harm your nervous system, kidneys, or hearing \u201cwater pills\u201d (diuretics) such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, or intravenous mannitol urea Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. What are the possible side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution? Tobramycin inhalation solution may cause serious side effects, including: severe breathing problems (bronchospasm). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these symptoms of bronchospasm with using tobramycin inhalation solution: shortness of breath with wheezing coughing and chest tightness hearing loss or ringing in the ears (ototoxicity). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have hearing loss or you hear noises in your ears such as ringing or hissing. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop vertigo, difficulty with balance or dizziness. worsening kidney problems (nephrotoxicity). Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs which may cause worsening kidney problems, especially in people with known or suspected kidney problems. Your healthcare provider may do a blood test to check how your kidneys are working while you are using tobramycin inhalation solution. worsening muscle weakness (neuromuscular disorder). Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs which can cause muscle weakness to get worse in people who already have problems with muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease). The most common side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution include: increased cough coughing up blood voice changes sore throat decreased lung function loss or change in taste increased sputum trouble breathing rash These are not all of the possible side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. General information about the safe and effective use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give it to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for more information about tobramycin inhalation solution that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution? Active ingredient: tobramycin Inactive ingredients: sodium chloride in sterile water for injection, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and nitrogen What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa? It is a very common bacterium that infects the lungs of nearly everyone with cystic fibrosis at some time during their lives. Some people do not get this infection until later in their lives, while others get it very young. It is one of the most damaging bacteria for people with cystic fibrosis. If the infection is not properly managed, it will continue to damage your lungs causing further problems to your breathing. For more information, go to www.amneal.com or call 1-877-835-5472.

      "Instructions for Use Tobramycin (toe\u201d bra mye\u2019 sin) Inhalation Solution For Oral Inhalation Use Read this Instructions for Use before you start using tobramycin inhalation solution and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution for inhalation. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A) : 1 Tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (Tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts ( See Figure D ): Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E) . (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F) . (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G) . The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H) . (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure I) . Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12 : Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure J) . (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup (See Figure K) . (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure L) . (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure M) . The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N) . Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O) . (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P) . If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q) . Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \u201cOff\u201d position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor. How should I store tobramycin inhalation solution? Store tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) until needed. You may store the tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the foil pouches (opened or unopened) at room temperature 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution ampules if they have been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days. Protect tobramycin inhalation solution ampules from light.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body\u2019s defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains , Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species . No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains , Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction and erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

      "BOXED WARNING Patients treated with Tobramycin for injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Sterile tobramycin sulfate is supplied as a sterile dry powder and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance : Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Test: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp , E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulphate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulphate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Category D - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). This product does not contain sodium. Information for Patients \u2014Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity \u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms \u2014The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function \u2014 Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated.

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration \u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation and Storage- Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package - Not for Direct Infusion. The pharmacy bulk package is for use in the Hospital Pharmacy Admixture Service and only in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Using aseptic technique, the closure may be penetrated only 1 time after reconstitution using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set, which allow measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. After entry, entire contents of Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle should be dispensed within 24 hours. Tobramycin for injection USP is supplied as a dry powder. The contents of the Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle should be diluted with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP to provide a solution containing 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. Prior to reconstitution, the Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle should be stored at controlled room temperature, 20 \u00ba to 25\u00ba C (6 8 \u00ba to 77\u00ba F). After reconstitution, the solution should be kept in a refrigerator and used within 96 hour. If kept at room temperature, the solution must be used within 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Tobramycin-Nomogram"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n = 258) % Placebo (n = 262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively.

Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265 128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u2265 16 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss\u00ae Pulmo-Aide\u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A): 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E). (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F). (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G). The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H) . (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure I). Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12 : Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure J) . (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup. (See Figure K). (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure L) . (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure M). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O) . (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color.

    "boxed_warning": [
      "BOXED WARNING Patients treated with Tobramycin for injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Sterile tobramycin sulfate is supplied as a sterile dry powder and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). Tobramycin-Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance : Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Test: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp , E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulphate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulphate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Category D - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). This product does not contain sodium. Information for Patients \u2014Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity \u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms \u2014The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin for injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function \u2014 Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ).

Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration \u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation and Storage- Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package - Not for Direct Infusion. The pharmacy bulk package is for use in the Hospital Pharmacy Admixture Service and only in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body\u2019s defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains , Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species . Bacterial susceptibility studies demonstrate that in some cases microorganisms resistant to gentamicin remain susceptible to tobramycin. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs. If the maximum dose of Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension is given for the first 48 hours (two drops in each eye every 2 hours) and complete systemic absorption occurs, which is highly unlikely, the daily dose of dexamethasone would be 2.4 mg. The usual physiologic replacement dose is 0.75 mg daily. If Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension is given after the first 48 hours as two drops in each eye every 4 hours, the administered dose of dexamethasone would be 1.2 mg daily."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension is indicated for steroid- responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae .

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Other adverse reactions have not been reported; however, if topical ocular tobramycin is administered concomitantly with systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics, care should be taken to monitor the total serum concentration. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection : The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosage Tobramycin inhalation solution is for oral inhalation only [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The recommended dosage of tobramycin inhalation solution for patients six years of age and older is to administer one single-dose ampule (300 mg/4 mL) twice daily by oral inhalation in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible and not less than 6 hours apart. The 300 mg/4 mL dose of tobramycin inhalation solution is the same for patients regardless of age or weight. Tobramycin inhalation solution has not been studied in patients less than six years old. If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a PARI Vios Air compressor over an approximately 15 minute period and until sputtering from the output of the nebulizer has occurred for at least one minute. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous, or intrathecal administration. Further patient instructions on how to administer tobramycin inhalation solution are provided in the Patient's Instructions for Use [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory, vestibular, renal, or neuromuscular dysfunction. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.5 ) Aminoglycoside may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. ( 5.3 ) Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.4 ) Audiograms, serum concentration, and renal function should be monitored as appropriate. ( 5.2 and 5.5 ) Fetal harm can occur when aminoglycosides are administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of the potential hazard to the fetus. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials. Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies. Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the tobramycin inhalation solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity. No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] , onset of this symptom warrants caution. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.2 Nephrotoxicity Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity was not seen during tobramycin inhalation solution clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL. Twenty-six (14%) tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 tobramycin inhalation solution patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution should have their renal function closely monitored. 5.3 Neuromuscular Disorders Tobramycin inhalation solution should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.4 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.5 Laboratory Tests Audiograms Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution. Serum Concentrations In patients with normal renal function treated with tobramycin inhalation solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06-1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing. Renal Function The clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the tobramycin inhalation solution group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.7 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions (more than 5%) occurring more frequently in tobramycin inhalation solution patients are forced expiratory volume decreased, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drugs cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to tobramycin inhalation solution in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution ranged in age from 6 to 31 years. In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug. All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (> 17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the tobramycin inhalation solution group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders. In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were \u2264 46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6-12 years old while 29% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 30% were adults (>17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa . Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of tobramycin inhalation solution -treated patients and at rates \u2265 2% more common compared to the placebo-treated patients: decreased forced expiratory volume, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia (Table 1).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to a mother. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [ Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although there are no available data on use of tobramycin inhalation solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u2265 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production following oral inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution have not been studied in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients under six years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the exposure of tobramycin. The risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 40 mg/dL have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 )] . Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician."

Although there are no available data on use of tobramycin inhalation solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u2265 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 )]."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE No overdoses have been reported with tobramycin inhalation solution in clinical trials. Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin inhalation solution is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. 1 The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. 2 Sputum Concentrations Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes. After four weeks of therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa . It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin. Cross Resistance Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable. Development of Resistance Treatment for six months with tobramycin inhalation solution in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Susceptibility Testing The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial. Susceptibility Testing Techniques Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods can be used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tobramycin that will inhibit the growth of the bacteria being tested. The MIC provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. The MIC should be determined using a standardized procedure. 3, 5 Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. 4, 5 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of tobramycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria In vitro susceptibility test interpretive criteria for inhaled tobramycin have not been determined. The relation of the in vitro MIC and/or disk diffusion susceptibility test results to clinical efficacy of inhaled tobramycin against the bacteria tested should be monitored. Quality Control Parameters for Susceptibility Testing In vitro susceptibility test quality control parameters exist for tobramycin so that laboratories that test the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tobramycin can determine if the susceptibility test is performing correctly. Standardized dilution techniques and diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tobramycin powder should provide the following MIC and a 10 mcg tobramycin disk should produce the following zone diameters with the indicated quality control strains (Table 2). Table 2: Acceptable Quality Control Ranges for Tobramycin Bacteria MIC Range (mcg/mL) Disk Diffusion Zone Diameter (mm) Pseudomonas \u00e6ruginosa ATCC 27853 0.25-1 19-25 Other No trends in the treatment-emergent isolation of other bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, or Staphylococcus aureus were observed in clinical trials of tobramycin inhalation solution relative to placebo. There was a slight increase in isolation of Candida spp in sputum at the end of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment cycle in clinical trials."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to tobramycin inhalation solution over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies. The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with tobramycin inhalation solution. In vitro cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed tobramycin inhalation solution and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer). All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV 1 % predicted \u2265 40% and \u226480% (mean baseline FEV 1 of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of \u2265 1.5 mg/dL, or who had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received tobramycin inhalation solution, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than P. aeruginosa . Study 1 Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive tobramycin inhalation solution (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis except for one patient who had missing baseline information. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 1 dosing in the primary analysis population. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 16% and 5%, respectively (LS mean difference = 11%; 95% CI: 3, 19; p=0.003). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over eight weeks. Study 2 Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-cycle, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 247 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three cycles of tobramycin inhalation solution (n=161) or placebo (n=86). As in Study 1, each cycle comprised 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. All patients were \u226446 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 44.9% were females. In this study, two randomized patients in the placebo group were not included in the primary efficacy analysis; one withdrew consent without taking any trial medication and the other withdrew due to an adverse drug reaction. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 3 \"ON\" period. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 7% and 1%, respectively (LS mean difference = 6%; 95% CI: 3, 10; p<0.001). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks from Study 2. Figure 1: FEV 1 % of Predicted Normal\u2013Absolute Change from Baseline (Adjusted mean)\u2013ITT Population In Study 2, 9.9% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution and 24.7% of patients who received placebo had unplanned hospitalizations due to the disease.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Information for Patients Information on the long term efficacy and safety of tobramycin inhalation solution is limited. There is no information in patients with severe cystic fibrosis (FEV 1 < 40% predicted). Patients should be advised to complete a full 28-day course of tobramycin inhalation solution, even if they are feeling better. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on and 28 day off cycle. For patients taking several different inhaled medications and/or performing chest physiotherapy, advise the patient regarding the order they should take the therapies. It is recommended that tobramycin inhalation solution be taken last. Tobramycin inhalation solution is to be used with the PARI LC PLUS reusable nebulizer and the PARI VIOS air compressor. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for care and use of the nebulizer and compressor. 17.1 Ototoxicity Inform patients that ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or tinnitus, was reported by patients treated with tobramycin. Physicians should consider an audiogram at baseline, particularly for patients at increased risk of auditory dysfunction. If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during tobramycin inhalation solution therapy, the physician should refer that patient for audiological assessment. Patients should be reminded that vestibular toxicity may manifest as vertigo, ataxia, or dizziness. 17.2 Bronchospasm Inform patients that bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin. 17.3 Risks Associated with Aminoglycosides Inform patients of adverse reactions associated with aminoglycosides such as nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular disorders. 17.4 Laboratory Tests Inform patients of the need to monitor hearing, serum concentrations of tobramycin, or renal function as necessary during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution. 17.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Inform patients that aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise them to inform their doctor if they are pregnant, become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. 17.6 Administration Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of tobramycin inhalation solution: In case a dose of tobramycin inhalation solution is missed and there are at least 6 hours until the next dose, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of tobramycin inhalation solution as soon as possible. Otherwise, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider if they have questions. 17.7 Storage Instructions You should store tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in a refrigerator (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F or 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). However, when you don't have a refrigerator available (e.g., transporting your tobramycin inhalation solution), you may store the foil pouches (opened or unopened) at room temperature (up to 77\u00b0F/25\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. Tobramycin inhalation solution is light sensitive; unopened ampules should be returned to the foil pouch. Avoid exposing tobramycin inhalation solution ampules to intense light. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally colorless to pale yellow, may darken with age; however, the color change does not indicate any change in the quality of the product. You should not use tobramycin inhalation solution if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days. You should not use tobramycin inhalation solution beyond the expiration date stamped on the ampule. Manufactured for: Northstar Rx LLC Memphis, TN 38141.

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics : Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Test: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin injection is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp, E. coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp and S. aureus. Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp , (indole-positive and indole- negative) , E. coli, Klebsiella sp , Enterobacter sp , Serratia sp , S. aureus, Providencia sp , and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Genera l \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use- See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use- Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS). Each mL of tobramycin (10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients \u2014 Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity\u2014 A dverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms\u2014 The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The patient\u2019s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function\u2014 Adults with Serious Infections : 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ).

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis\u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function\u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals\u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals\u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients\u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration\u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. tobramycin-spl-figure"

Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. Bacterial susceptibility studies demonstrate that in some cases, microorganisms resistant to gentamicin retain susceptibility to tobramycin."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3% is a topical antibiotic indicated in the treatment of external infections of the eye and its adnexa caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate monitoring of bacterial response to topical antibiotic therapy should accompany the use of tobramycin ophthalmic solution. Clinical studies have shown tobramycin to be safe and effective for use in children."

      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction to tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3% occurs, discontinue use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy: Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension 0.5%/0.3% is a topical anti-infective and corticosteroid combination for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product (tobramycin) is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae , and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts : Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing : The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Viral Infections : Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). ( 5.5 ) Fungal Infections : Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 5.2 Cataracts Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. 5.3 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension 0.5%/0.3% In a 42-day safety study comparing Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension to placebo, ocular adverse reactions included injection (approximately 20%) and superficial punctate keratitis (approximately 15%). Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Most common adverse reactions reported in patients were injection and superficial punctate keratitis, increased intraocular pressure, burning and stinging upon instillation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD)."

In the lid inflammation trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius , Moraxella lacunata , Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between LOTEMAX \u00ae and Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension treatment groups. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n = 258) % Placebo (n = 262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively.

There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor. Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with 5 tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test. Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen n=258 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution -treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265 128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u2265 16 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1% Predicted Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs"

If the infection is not properly managed, it will continue to damage your lungs causing further problems to your breathing. Manufactured for: Northstar Rx LLC Memphis, TN 38141. Manufactured by: Mankind Pharma Limited Paonta Sahib, Sirmaur Himachal Pradesh 173025, India. For more information, call 1-800-206-7821. This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Issued : 04/2024, V-01 Instructions for Use Tobramycin (toe-brah-MYE-sin) Inhalation Solution for oral inhalation use Read this Instructions for Use before you start using tobramycin inhalation solution and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss\u00ae Pulmo-Aide\u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A): 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E). (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F). (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G). The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H) . (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure I). Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12 : Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure J) . (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup. (See Figure K). (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure L) . (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure M). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O) . (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% is a topical anti- infective and corticosteroid combination for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product (tobramycin) is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae, and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species . LOTEPREDNOL ETABONATE and TOBRAMYCIN ophthalmic suspension is a combination of loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid, and tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts: Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing: The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Viral Infections: Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). (5.5) Fungal Infections: Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 5.2 Cataracts Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. 5.3 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as a slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.4 Bacterial Infections Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.

Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). 5.6 Fungal Infections Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. 5.7 Aminoglycoside Hypersensitivity Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. If hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 5.8 Risk of Contamination Do not allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. 5.9 Contact Lens Wear As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% In a 42-day safety study comparing loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% to placebo, ocular adverse reactions included injection (approximately 20%) and superficial punctate keratitis (approximately 15%). Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Most common adverse reactions reported in patients were injection and superficial punctate keratitis, increased intraocular pressure, burning and stinging upon instillation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD)."

In the lid inflammation trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5% and loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% treatment groups. . Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae.

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. (1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius. (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days tobramycin inhalation solution regimen n=258 tobramycin inhalation solution 300 mg twice daily No drug tobramycin inhalation solution 300mg twice daily No drug tobramycin inhalation solution 300mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen. tob02 tob03.jpg"

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Tobramycin (Toe-Bra-MYE-Sin) inhalation solution for oral inhalation use What is tobramycin inhalation solution? Tobramycin inhalation solution is a prescription medicine that is used to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have a bacterial infection called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tobramycin inhalation solution contains an antibacterial medicine called tobramycin (an aminoglycoside). It is not known if tobramycin inhalation solution is safe and effective: in children under 6 years of age in people who have an FEV 1 less than 25% or greater than 75% predicted in people who are colonized with a bacterium called Burkholderia cepacia Do not take tobramycin inhalation solution if you are allergic to tobramycin, any of the ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution, or to any other aminoglycoside antibacterial. See the end of this Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution. Before you take tobramycin inhalation solution, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had hearing problems (including noises in your ears such as ringing or hissing), hearing loss, or your mother has had hearing problems after taking an aminoglycoside. have been told you have certain gene variants (a change in the gene) related to hearing abnormalities inherited from your mother. have dizziness have or have had kidney problems have or have had problems with muscle weakness such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease have or have had breathing problems such as wheezing, coughing, or chest tightness are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs that can harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if tobramycin inhalation solution passes into your breast milk. are receiving aminoglycoside therapy by injection or through a vein (intravenous) while taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Your blood levels of tobramycin will be checked. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How should I take tobramycin inhalation solution? See the step-by-step Instructions for Use about the right way to take your tobramycin inhalation solution. Take tobramycin inhalation solution exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Do not change your dose or stop taking tobramycin inhalation solution unless your healthcare provider tells you to. The usual dose for adults and children over 6 years of age is: 1 single-use ampule of tobramycin inhalation solution inhaled 2 times each day using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss\u00ae Pulmo-Aide\u00ae air compressor. Each dose of tobramycin inhalation solution should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible. You should not take your dose less than 6 hours apart. Tobramycin inhalation solution is taken as a breathing treatment (inhalation) with a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Do not use any other nebulizer for your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment. Do not mix or dilute tobramycin inhalation solution with dornase alfa or other medicines in your nebulizer system. Each treatment should take about 15 minutes. Tobramycin inhalation solution should be inhaled while you are sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help you to breathe through your mouth. If you forget to take tobramycin inhalation solution and there are at least 6 hours to your next dose, take your dose as soon as you can.Otherwise, wait for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for the missed dose. After using tobramycin inhalation solution for 28 days, you should stop using it and wait 28 days. After you have stopped using tobramycin inhalation solution for 28 days, you should start using tobramycin inhalation solution again for 28 days. Complete the full 28-day course even if you are feeling better. It is important that you keep to the 28-day on, 28-day off cycle. If you are taking several medicines or treatments to treat your cystic fibrosis, you should take your medicines or other treatments before inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by your healthcare provider. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using tobramycin inhalation solution with certain other medicines can cause serious side effects. If you are using tobramycin inhalation solution, you should discuss with your healthcare provider if you should take: other medicines that may harm your nervous system, kidneys, or hearing \"water pills\" (diuretics) such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, or intravenous mannitol urea Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. What are the possible side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution? Tobramycin inhalation solution may cause serious side effects, including: severe breathing problems (bronchospasm). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these symptoms of bronchospasm with using tobramycin inhalation solution: shortness of breath with wheezing coughing and chest tightness hearing loss or ringing in the ears (ototoxicity). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have hearing loss or you hear noises in your ears such as ringing or hissing. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop vertigo, difficulty with balance or dizziness. worsening kidney problems (nephrotoxicity). Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs which may cause worsening kidney problems, especially in people with known or suspected kidney problems. Your healthcare provider may do a blood test to check how your kidneys are working while you are using tobramycin inhalation solution. worsening muscle weakness (neuromuscular disorder). Tobramycin inhalation solution is in a class of drugs which can cause muscle weakness to get worse in people who already have problems with muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease). The most common side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution include: o increased cough o sore throat o increased sputum o coughing up blood o decreased lung function o trouble breathing o voice changes o loss or change in taste o rash These are not all of the possible side effects of tobramycin inhalation solution. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. General information about the safe and effective use of tobramycin inhalation solution Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give it to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for more information about tobramycin inhalation solution that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in tobramycin inhalation solution? Active ingredient: tobramycin Inactive ingredients: sodium chloride in sterile water for injection, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and nitrogen What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa? It is a very common bacterium that infects the lungs of nearly everyone with cystic fibrosis at some time during their lives. Some people do not get this infection until later in their lives, while others get it very young. It is one of the most damaging bacteria for people with cystic fibrosis. If the infection is not properly managed, it will continue to damage your lungs causing further problems to your breathing.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Tobramycin (Toe-Bra-MYE-Sin) inhalation solution for oral inhalation use Read this Instructions for Use before you start using tobramycin inhalation solution and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS TM Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A): 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (Tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 7 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B). Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C). Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D): Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E). (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F). (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G). The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H). (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure I). Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12: Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure J). (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup. (See Figure K). (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure L). (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure M). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O). (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20: Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \"Off\" position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor. How should I store tobramycin inhalation solution?

    "boxed_warning": [
      "BOXED WARNING Patients treated with Tobramycin for injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Sterile tobramycin sulfate is supplied as a sterile dry powder and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ).

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance : Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) . Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci.

Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp , E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulphate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulphate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Category D - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). This product does not contain sodium. Information for Patients \u2014Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity \u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms \u2014The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin for injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function \u2014 Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 3 DOSAGE SCHEDULE GUIDE FOR TOBRAMYCIN FOR INJECTION, USP IN ADULTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION (Dosage at 8-Hour Intervals) For Patient Weighing Usual Dose for Serious Infections 1 mg/kg q8h (Total, 3mg/kg/day) Maximum Dose for Life-Threatening Infections (Reduce as soon as possible) 1.66 mg/kg q8h (Total, 5 mg/kg/day) kg lb mg/dose* mL/dose* m g/dose mL/dose q8h q8h 120 264 120 mg 3 mL 200 mg 5 mL 115 253 115 mg 2.9 mL 191 mg 4.75 mL 110 242 110 mg 2.75 mL 183 mg 4.5 mL 105 231 105 mg 2.6 mL 175 mg 4.4 mL 100 220 100 mg 2.5 mL 166 mg 4.2 mL 95 209 95 mg 2.4 mL 158 mg 4 mL 90 198 90 mg 2.25 mL 150 mg 3.75 mL 85 187 85 mg 2.1 mL 141 mg 3.5 mL 80 176 80 mg 2 mL 133 mg 3.3 mL 75 165 75 mg 1.9 mL 125 mg 3.1 mL 70 154 70 mg 1.75 mL 116 mg 2.9 mL 65 143 65 mg 1.6 mL 108 mg 2.7 mL 60 132 60 mg 1.5 mL 100 mg 2.5 mL 55 121 55 mg 1.4 mL 91 mg 2.25 mL 50 110 50 mg 1.25 mL 83 mg 2.1 mL 45 99 45 mg 1.1 mL 75 mg 1.9 mL 40 88 40 mg 1 mL 66 mg 1.6 mL *Applicable to all product forms except Tobramycin Injection, USP, 10 mg /mL (Pediatric). Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration \u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION: Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin Injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 40 mg tobramycin; sodium metabisulfite added as an antioxidant, 3.2 mg; and edetate disodium added as a stabilizer, 0.1 mg. Contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment (3.0 to 6.5). Tobramycin sulfate is, O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924) - O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5)(salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.42. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion or to the filling of empty sterile syringes for intravenous injection for patients with individualized dosing requirements. FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED BEFORE USE (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). tobra-struc-01.jpg"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half- life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Antimicrobial Activity: Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginos a, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus. Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin 20 mg/2 mL vial contains 1.56 mg (0.068 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated."

      "Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus."

      "Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin 20 mg/2 mL vial contains 1.56 mg (0.068 mEq) of sodium."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE: Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to- date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: This package insert labeling is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing intravenous admixtures only. Dosage recommendations and/or references for the intramuscular route of administration are for informational purposes only. Tobramycin Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3 ). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3 ). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 3.

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. tobra-fig-01.jpg Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package Use Aseptic Technique - Not for Direct Infusion The pharmacy bulk package is for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only. 1. For hanger use, grasp portion of the bottle label marked \"LIFT HERE\". Peel the laminated film (sling) away from the printed portion of the pressure sensitive label. Invert bottle and pull sling over the base of the bottle. Hang bottle using sling portion of the label. 2. During use, container must be stored and all manipulations performed in an appropriate laminar flow hood. 3. Remove cover from container and cleanse closure with antiseptic. 4. A single entry through the vial closure should be made with a sterile dispensing set which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Transfer individual dose(s) to appropriate intravenous infusion solutions without delay. Use of a syringe with needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. Multiple entries will also increase the potential of microbial and particulate contamination. The above process should be carried out under a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique. ANY UNUSED PORTION MUST BE DISCARDED WITHIN 4 HOURS. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information For Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies in three types of animals at doses up to thirty-three times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory, vestibular, renal, or neuromuscular dysfunction. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.5 ) Aminoglycoside may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. ( 5.3 ) Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.4 ) Audiograms, serum concentration, and renal function should be monitored as appropriate. ( 5.2 and 5.5 ) Fetal harm can occur when aminoglycosides are administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of the potential hazard to the fetus. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials. Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies. Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the tobramycin inhalation solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity. No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] , onset of this symptom warrants caution. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.2 Nephrotoxicity Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity was not seen during tobramycin inhalation solution clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL. Twenty-six (14%) tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 tobramycin inhalation solution patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution should have their renal function closely monitored. 5.3 Neuromuscular Disorders Tobramycin inhalation solution should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.4 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.5 Laboratory Tests Audiograms Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution. Serum Concentrations In patients with normal renal function treated with tobramycin inhalation solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06-1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing. Renal Function The clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the tobramycin inhalation solution group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.7 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drugs cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to tobramycin inhalation solution in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution ranged in age from 6 to 31 years. In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug. All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (> 17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the tobramycin inhalation solution group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders. In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were \u2264 46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6-12 years old while 29% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 30% were adults (>17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa . Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of tobramycin inhalation solution -treated patients and at rates \u2265 2% more common compared to the placebo-treated patients: decreased forced expiratory volume, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia (Table 1).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to a mother. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [ Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Although there are no available data on use of tobramycin inhalation solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u2265 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production following oral inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution have not been studied in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients under six years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the exposure of tobramycin. The risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 40 mg/dL have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 )] . Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin inhalation solution is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. 1 The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. 2 Sputum Concentrations Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes. After four weeks of therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa . It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin. Cross Resistance Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable. Development of Resistance Treatment for six months with tobramycin inhalation solution in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Susceptibility Testing The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial. Susceptibility Testing Techniques Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods can be used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tobramycin that will inhibit the growth of the bacteria being tested. The MIC provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. The MIC should be determined using a standardized procedure. 3, 5 Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. 4, 5 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of tobramycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria In vitro susceptibility test interpretive criteria for inhaled tobramycin have not been determined. The relation of the in vitro MIC and/or disk diffusion susceptibility test results to clinical efficacy of inhaled tobramycin against the bacteria tested should be monitored. Quality Control Parameters for Susceptibility Testing In vitro susceptibility test quality control parameters exist for tobramycin so that laboratories that test the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tobramycin can determine if the susceptibility test is performing correctly. Standardized dilution techniques and diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tobramycin powder should provide the following MIC and a 10 mcg tobramycin disk should produce the following zone diameters with the indicated quality control strains (Table 2). Table 2: Acceptable Quality Control Ranges for Tobramycin Bacteria MIC Range (mcg/mL) Disk Diffusion Zone Diameter (mm) Pseudomonas \u00e6ruginosa ATCC 27853 0.25-1 19-25 Other No trends in the treatment-emergent isolation of other bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, or Staphylococcus aureus were observed in clinical trials of tobramycin inhalation solution relative to placebo. There was a slight increase in isolation of Candida spp in sputum at the end of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment cycle in clinical trials."

The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with five tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test.

There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumors. Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with five tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test. Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to tobramycin inhalation solution over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies. The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with tobramycin inhalation solution. In vitro cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed tobramycin inhalation solution and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer). All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV 1 % predicted \u2265 40% and \u226480% (mean baseline FEV 1 of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of \u2265 1.5 mg/dL, or who had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received tobramycin inhalation solution, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than P. aeruginosa . Study 1 Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive tobramycin inhalation solution (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis except for one patient who had missing baseline information. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 1 dosing in the primary analysis population. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 16% and 5%, respectively (LS mean difference = 11%; 95% CI: 3, 19; p=0.003). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over eight weeks. Study 2 Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-cycle, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 247 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three cycles of tobramycin inhalation solution (n=161) or placebo (n=86). As in Study 1, each cycle comprised 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. All patients were \u226446 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 44.9% were females. In this study, two randomized patients in the placebo group were not included in the primary efficacy analysis; one withdrew consent without taking any trial medication and the other withdrew due to an adverse drug reaction. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 3 \"ON\" period. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 7% and 1%, respectively (LS mean difference = 6%; 95% CI: 3, 10; p<0.001). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks from Study 2. Figure 1: FEV 1 % of Predicted Normal\u2013Absolute Change from Baseline (Adjusted mean)\u2013ITT Population In Study 2, 9.9% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution and 24.7% of patients who received placebo had unplanned hospitalizations due to the disease. Also in Study 2, 6.2% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution and 16.5% of placebo patients received parenteral tobramycin. Figure 1"

Information for Patients Information on the long term efficacy and safety of tobramycin inhalation solution is limited. There is no information in patients with severe cystic fibrosis (FEV 1 < 40% predicted). Patients should be advised to complete a full 28-day course of tobramycin inhalation solution, even if they are feeling better. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on and 28 day off cycle. For patients taking several different inhaled medications and/or performing chest physiotherapy, advise the patient regarding the order they should take the therapies. It is recommended that tobramycin inhalation solution be taken last. Tobramycin inhalation solution is to be used with the PARI LC PLUS reusable nebulizer and the PARI VIOS air compressor. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for care and use of the nebulizer and compressor. 17.1 Ototoxicity Inform patients that ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or tinnitus, was reported by patients treated with tobramycin. Physicians should consider an audiogram at baseline, particularly for patients at increased risk of auditory dysfunction. If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during tobramycin inhalation solution therapy, the physician should refer that patient for audiological assessment. Patients should be reminded that vestibular toxicity may manifest as vertigo, ataxia, or dizziness. 17.2 Bronchospasm Inform patients that bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin. 17.3 Risks Associated with Aminoglycosides Inform patients of adverse reactions associated with aminoglycosides such as nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular disorders. 17.4 Laboratory Tests Inform patients of the need to monitor hearing, serum concentrations of tobramycin, or renal function as necessary during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution. 17.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Inform patients that aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise them to inform their doctor if they are pregnant, become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. 17.6 Administration Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of tobramycin inhalation solution: In case a dose of tobramycin inhalation solution is missed and there are at least 6 hours until the next dose, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of tobramycin inhalation solution as soon as possible.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE-Not for Direct Infusion: Dispense single doses to many patients in a pharmacy admixture program. Pharmacy bulk package vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration ( 2.1 , 2.8 ) Recommended adult dosages are as follows: Serious Infections: Administer 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses (i.e. 1 mg/kg every 8 hours) Life-threatening Infections: Administer up to 5 mg/kg in 3 or 4 equal doses See full prescribing information for the recommended dosage for pediatric patients ( 2.3 ), patients with cystic fibrosis ( 2.5 ), patients with renal impairment ( 2.6 ), and obese patients ( 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Pharmacy Bulk Package-Not for Direct Infusion Tobramycin for Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package is intended for dispensing of single doses to many patients in a hospital pharmacy admixture service. It should only be prepared in an aseptic work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Tobramycin for Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 )] . After reconstitution, the closure may be penetrated only one time using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set, which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. After penetration, the entire contents of the bulk vial must be dispensed within 24 hours. Do not administer Tobramycin for Injection as a direct, undiluted intravenous injection. 2.2 Dosage for Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Tobramycin for Injection may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The recommended dosage is as follows: Adult Patients Adults with Serious Infections 3 mg/kg/day administered in 3 equal doses of 1 mg/kg every 8 hours. Adults with Life-Threatening Infections Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 1 ). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive serum concentrations, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum concentrations are monitored [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )].

Premature or Full-Term Neonates (1 Week of Age or Less): Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. 2.4 Duration of Treatment for Adult and Pediatric Patients The usual duration of treatment for adult and pediatric patients is 7 to10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. 2.5 Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis or Burns In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. An initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is suggested as a guide. The serum concentrations of tobramycin should be monitored during treatment due to wide inter-patient variability. Similarly, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations in patients with extensive burns. Monitoring tobramycin serum concentration in these patients is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 2.6 Dosage for Patients with Renal Impairment Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides and dose should be adjusted based on serum concentration. The dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and serum tobramycin concentration monitoring and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals When the creatinine clearance rate is less than or equal to 70 mL per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose in adult patients from Table 1 by the percent of the normal dosage from the accompanying nomogram in Figure 1 below. Figure 1: NOMOGRAM Figure 1: NOMOGRAM Normal dosage at prolonged intervals If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the recommended adult dose can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. 2.7 Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the weight on which to determine the dose in mg/kg. 2.8 Instructions for Preparation and Intravenous Administration Tobramycin for Injection is supplied as a dry powder in a pharmacy bulk package vial that contains the equivalent of 1.2 g of tobramycin. The contents of the vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration as follows: Reconstitute the contents of the pharmacy bulk package vial aseptically with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP to provide a reconstituted solution containing 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. Dilute the reconstituted pharmacy bulk vial prior to intravenous administration by adding a specified volume of the reconstituted solution to 50 to 100 mL (for adult doses) of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) for each patient. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. After penetration, entire contents of pharmacy bulk vial should be dispensed within 24 hours. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration The diluted solution should be intravenously infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Intravenous infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum concentrations may exceed 12 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 2.9 Measurement of Serum Concentrations of Tobramycin Measure peak and trough serum tobramycin concentrations periodically during therapy to assure adequate concentrations and to avoid potentially toxic concentrations in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Avoid peak serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL. Rising trough concentrations (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation may result in ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . A useful guideline is to measure serum concentrations after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, obtain more frequent serum tobramycin concentrations and adjust the dosage or dosage interval according to the guidelines provided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. In order to measure the peak concentration, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough concentrations are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-concentration assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less susceptible organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. 2.10 Drug Incompatibilities Tobramycin should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Allergic Reactions: anaphylaxis, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported in patients on Tobramycin for Injection therapy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy ( 5.4 ) Neuromuscular Blockade: Respiratory paralysis can occur at high doses or with concurrent use of neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, consider administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.5 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Nephrotoxicity Systemic exposure to Tobramycin for Injection and other aminoglycosides can cause nephrotoxicity, primarily manifested as acute tubular necrosis. Signs of nephrotoxicity include rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), decreased urinary output, and sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, phosphate and calcium urinary losses. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity may occur during therapy but may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy and usually is reversible. The risk for nephrotoxicity increases with tobramycin accumulation (indicated by rising trough levels above 2 mcg/mL), excessive peak concentrations (above 12 mcg/mL), total cumulative dose, advanced age, volume depletion, concurrent or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs and in patients with diabetes. Monitor serum tobramycin concentrations in all patients and avoid peak levels above 12 mcg/mL and trough levels above 2 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Monitor renal function, serum electrolytes, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate, urine output and urinalysis during therapy in all patients. Reduce the dose or discontinue treatment if renal impairment occurs. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin for Injection Tobramycin for Injection can cause both auditory and vestibular eighth nerve damage. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Symptoms of ototoxicity can include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears and hearing loss. Ototoxicity symptoms may manifest during therapy or after tobramycin has been discontinued. The risk of ototoxicity increases with higher peak and trough serum tobramycin concentrations, in patients who receive high doses or prolonged or prior treatment with tobramycin or other aminoglycosides, in patients with renal impairment, patients receiving with other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs and in the extremes of age. To decrease the risk of ototoxicity, use as short a duration of therapy as clinically appropriate, adequately hydrate patients, limit the use of other ototoxic drugs, and closely monitor tobramycin concentrations during therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of auditory or vestibular toxicity and consider serial audiograms in high-risk patients. Discontinue tobramycin in patients with evidence of auditory or vestibular toxicity. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta. Streptomycin, another aminoglycoside, has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Apprise patients of potential hazard to the fetus if Tobramycin for Injection is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Tobramycin for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.4 Allergic Reactions Serious and fatal allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported in patients on tobramycin therapy [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue Tobramycin for Injection and institute appropriate therapy. A history of hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides is a contraindication to the use of Tobramycin for Injection, because cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.5 Neuromuscular Blockade and Other Neurologic Adverse Reactions Neuromuscular blockade with respiratory paralysis and respiratory failure may occur following administration of aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly and be more severe in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease and in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs following the administration of Tobramycin for Injection, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin for Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Risk of Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Tobramycin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Macular Necrosis Tobramycin for Injection is not approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Macular necrosis has been reported following intraocular and/ or subconjunctival administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin. 5.9 Inactivation by Beta-Lactam Antibacterials The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibacterials (penicillins, cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs with Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential Avoid concurrent and/or sequential use of Tobramycin for Injection with other drugs with nephrotoxic and/or ototoxic potential. 7.2 Diuretics Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering concentrations in serum and tissue and causing dehydration. Monitor serum concentrations, renal function, serum electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate, urine output and urinalysis, and signs of auditory or vestibular toxicity in patients concomitantly administered diuretics. 7.3 Drugs with Neuromuscular Blockade or Neurotoxic Potential Prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents with Tobramycin for Injection [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. In addition, avoid concurrent and/or sequential use of Tobramycin for Injection with other neurotoxic drugs."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes at doses up to 3.2 times and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively. Data Animal Data Subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (rat) or 20 mg/kg/day (rabbit) during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. These doses are 3.2 and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical daily dose of 5 mg/kg based on body surface area. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published data with Tobramycin for Injection in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of Tobramycin for Injection on milk production. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tobramycin for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tobramycin for Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Use Tobramycin for Injection with caution in premature infants and neonates because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes at doses up to 3.2 times and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively. Data Animal Data Subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (rat) or 20 mg/kg/day (rabbit) during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. These doses are 3.2 and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical daily dose of 5 mg/kg based on body surface area. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms Acute overdosage with Tobramycin for Injection can result in more severe manifestations of the types of toxicities known to occur with recommended doses, e.g., renal damage, ototoxicity, neuromuscular blockade. The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.5 )] for signs and symptoms related to neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade; and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are minimally absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. 10.2 Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage with Tobramycin for Injection, call your Regional Poison Control Center or the National Poison Control center at 1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. Management of Tobramycin for Injection overdosage is symptomatic and supportive. Maintain airway, provide adequate hydration and monitor renal function, serum electrolytes, and tobramycin concentrations until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Tobramycin is removed by hemodialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibacterial drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in serum. The serum elimination half-life in patients with normal renal function is 2 hours. However, in patients with renal impairment and in neonates, serum concentrations of the antibacterial are usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in adults with normal renal function. Thus, the dosage of Tobramycin for Injection for patients with renal impairment and neonates must be adjusted accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.6 )]. Absorption Following intramuscular administration, peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable concentrations persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum concentrations are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When Tobramycin for Injection is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution Based on ultrafiltration studies, practically no serum protein binding of tobramycin occurs. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations of tobramycin in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimal biliary excretion. The concentration of tobramycin in cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration is low, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. Tobramycin has also been detected in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than serum concentrations. Metabolism Following parenteral administration, minimal, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Excretion Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood concentrations. Drug Interactions Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the aminoacyl site (A) of the 16S RNA within the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Tobramycin is bactericidal against susceptible bacteria. Resistance Resistance to aminoglycosides includes production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs), alteration of the ribosomal target through production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases, up-regulation of efflux pumps and reduced permeability into bacterial cell due to loss of outer membrane porins. Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibacterial that interferes with cell-wall synthesis, such as penicillin, results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in some isolates of Enterococcus faecalis . This combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium. Species-level identification of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibacterial synergism must be performed. Antimicrobial Activity Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] : Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter species Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia species Serratia species Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Allergic Reactions Advise patients that serious allergic reactions could occur with Tobramycin for Injection. Advise patients to report fever, swelling, difficulty breathing, wheezing, decrease blood pressure or dizziness, or skin rash. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy immediately. Impairment of Kidney Function Advise patients that Tobramycin for Injection may cause impairment in kidney function and that periodic blood draws are required to monitor kidney function and tobramycin drug levels. Hearing Loss and Impaired Balance Advise patients that Tobramycin for Injection may cause serious and irreversible hearing loss and impaired balance. Advise patients to report hearing loss, ringing or roaring in the ears, dizziness or imbalance. Antibacterial Resistance Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including Tobramycin for Injection should be used to treat bacterial infections only. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Tobramycin for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be administered exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Tobramycin for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Embryofetal Toxicity Advise pregnant women that aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause irreversible congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Lactation Advise a woman to monitor their breastfed infants for diarrhea and/or bloody stools [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )]. Novaplus is a registered trademark of Vizient, Inc.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased Pharyngitis Sputum Increased Dyspnea Hemoptysis Lung Function Decreased 1 Voice Alteration Taste Perversion Rash 46.1 38.0 37.6 33.7 19.4 16.3 12.8 6.6 5.4 47.3 39.3 39.7 38.5 23.7 15.3 6.5 6.9 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.

In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen. tobramycin-fig1.jpg tobramycin-fig2.jpg"

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor and PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A) : 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch (See Figure B) . (Figure B) Step 3: Take 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule from a pouch (See Figure C) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure C) Step 4: Tare a ampule(s) from the pack (See Figure D) . (Figure D) Step 5: Check the expiration date printed on the bottom of ampule (See Figure E) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure E) Step 6: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 7: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure F) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure F) Step 8: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure G).

(Figure R) Step 20: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure S). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure S) Step 21 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth.

    "boxed_warning": [
      "BOXED WARNING WARNINGS Patients treated with tobramycin for injection and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin for injection, USP is supplied as a sterile dry powder and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of sterile water for injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5)(salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u20225H 2 SO 4. The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ) .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecali s. However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: - Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa, E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. - Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli, and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). - Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. - Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. - Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp, E. coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus. - Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See W ARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or the dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see W ARNING S and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). This product does not contain sodium. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and not be treatable by tobramycin or any other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function where dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and who have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient\u2019s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients With Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 1). Adults With Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 1). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 1.

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less : Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients With Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 1 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. Reduced Dosage Nomogram Creatine Clearance Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 1 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin ophthalmic solution USP, 0.3% is a sterile topical ophthalmic antibiotic formulation prepared specifically for topical therapy of external ophthalmic infections. Each mL contains: Active: tobramycin 3 mg (0.3%). Inactives: boric acid, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, tyloxapol and purified water. Sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid (to adjust pH). Tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3% has a pH range between 7.0 and 8.0. Preservative: benzalkonium chloride 0.1 mg (0.01%). Tobramycin is a water-soluble aminoglycoside antibiotic active against a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive ophthalmic pathogens. The chemical structure of tobramycin is: Chemical name: (2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)-4-amino-2-[(1S,2S,3R,4S,6R)-4,6-diamino-3-[(2R,3R,5S,6R)-3-amino-6-(aminomethyl)-5-hydroxyoxan-2-yl]oxy-2-hydroxycyclohexyl]oxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-3,5-diol chem"

Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction to tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3% occurs, discontinue use."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts: Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing: The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Viral Infections: Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). (5.5) Fungal Infections: Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use.

Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis.

Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5% and loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% treatment groups. . Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin."

    "microbiology": [
      "Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus . Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp (indole- positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3-to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Each mL of tobramycin (40 mg/mL) contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 3.

Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. tobramycin-nomogram Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals - If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: In Vitro Data: In Vitro studies have demonstrated tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A betahemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. Bacterial susceptibility studies demonstrate that in some cases, microorganisms resistant to gentamicin retain susceptibility to tobramycin."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution USP, 0.3% is a topical antibiotic indicated in the treatment of external infections of the eye and its adnexa caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate monitoring of bacterial response to topical antibiotic therapy should accompany the use of Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution USP, 0.3%. Clinical studies have shown tobramycin to be safe and effective for use in pediatric patients."

      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. If a sensitivity reaction to Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution USP, 0.3% occurs, discontinue use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies in three types of animals at doses up to thirty-three times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of two months has not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between the elderly and other adult patients."

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNINGS Patients treated with tobramycin injection and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 40 mg tobramycin; phenol added as a preservative, 5 mg; sodium bisulfite added as an antioxidant, 3.2 mg; and edetate disodium added as a stabilizer, 0.1 mg. Contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. pH (3.0 to 6.5). Tobramycin 80 mg/2 mL vial contains 1.568 mg (0.0682 mEq) of sodium. Tobramycin 1.2 g/30 mL vial contains 23.52 mg (1.0226 mEq) of sodium. Tobramycin sulfate is, O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5)(salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.45. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus. Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C.difficile. C.difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C.difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C.difficile ,and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Category D \u2014 Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use \u2014 See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use \u2014 Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients \u2014 Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity\u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity\u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, itching, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms \u2014 The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

The patient\u2019s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function \u2014Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated.

Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals\u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration\u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. serum creatinine"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% is a topical antibiotic indicated in the treatment of external infections of the eye and its adnexa caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate monitoring of bacterial response to topical antibiotic therapy should accompany the use of tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%. Clinical studies have shown tobramycin to be safe and effective for use in children."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction to tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% occurs, discontinue use."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy: Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions to tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than three of 100 patients treated with tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with systemic aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection. Information For Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies in three types of animals at doses up to thirty-three times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution to patients with known or suspected auditory, vestibular, renal, or neuromuscular dysfunction. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.5 ) Aminoglycoside may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. ( 5.3 ) Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. ( 5.4 ) Audiograms, serum concentration, and renal function should be monitored as appropriate. ( 5.2 and 5.5 ) Fetal harm can occur when aminoglycosides are administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of the potential hazard to the fetus. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials. Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies. Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms Tobramycin Inhalation Solution of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution- and placebo-treated patients. Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity. No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] , onset of this symptom warrants caution. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.2 Nephrotoxicity Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity was not seen during Tobramycin Inhalation Solution clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL. Twenty-six (14%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should have their renal function closely monitored. 5.3 Neuromuscular Disorders Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.4 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.5 Laboratory Tests Audiograms Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution. Serum Concentrations In patients with normal renal function treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06-1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing. Renal Function The clinical studies of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use Tobramycin Inhalation Solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.7 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

The data described below reflect exposure to Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving Tobramycin Inhalation Solution ranged in age from 6 to 31 years. In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug. All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (> 17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders. In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were \u2264 46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6-12 years old while 29% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 30% were adults (>17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa . Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both Tobramycin Inhalation Solution- and placebo-treated patients.

( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to a mother. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Although there are no available data on use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u2265 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production following oral inhalation of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tobramycin Inhalation Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution have not been studied in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients under six years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the exposure of tobramycin. The risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with serum creatinine > 2mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 40mg/dL have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tobramycin Inhalation Solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. 1 The bioavailability of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. 2 Sputum Concentrations Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes. After four weeks of therapy with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g. Distribution Following administration of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa . It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin. Cross Resistance Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable. Development of Resistance Treatment for six months with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Susceptibility Testing The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial. Susceptibility Testing Techniques Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods can be used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tobramycin that will inhibit the growth of the bacteria being tested. The MIC provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. The MIC should be determined using a standardized procedure. 3, 5 Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. 4, 5 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of tobramycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria In vitro susceptibility test interpretive criteria for inhaled tobramycin have not been determined. The relation of the in vitro MIC and/or disk diffusion susceptibility test results to clinical efficacy of inhaled tobramycin against the bacteria tested should be monitored. Quality Control Parameters for Susceptibility Testing In vitro susceptibility test quality control parameters exist for tobramycin so that laboratories that test the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tobramycin can determine if the susceptibility test is performing correctly. Standardized dilution techniques and diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tobramycin powder should provide the following MIC and a 10 mcg tobramycin disk should produce the following zone diameters with the indicated quality control strains ( Table 2 ). Table 2: Acceptable Quality Control Ranges for Tobramycin Bacteria MIC Range (mcg/mL) Disk Diffusion Zone Diameter (mm) Pseudomonas \u00e6ruginosa ATCC 27853 0.25-1 19-25 Other No trends in the treatment-emergent isolation of other bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, or Staphylococcus aureus were observed in clinical trials of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution relative to placebo. There was a slight increase in isolation of Candida spp in sputum at the end of the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution treatment cycle in clinical trials."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to Tobramycin Inhalation Solution over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies. The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. In vitro cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer). All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV 1 % predicted \u2265 40% and \u2264 80% (mean baseline FEV 1 of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of \u2265 1.5 mg/dL, or who had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than P. aeruginosa . Study 1 Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were \u2264 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis except for one patient who had missing baseline information. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 1 dosing in the primary analysis population. Treatment with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 16% and 5%, respectively (LS mean difference = 11%; 95% CI: 3, 19; p=0.003). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over eight weeks. Study 2 Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-cycle, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 247 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three cycles of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=161) or placebo (n=86). As in Study 1, each cycle comprised 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. All patients were \u226446 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 44.9% were females. In this study, two randomized patients in the placebo group were not included in the primary efficacy analysis; one withdrew consent without taking any trial medication and the other withdrew due to an adverse drug reaction. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 3 \u201cON\u201d period. Treatment with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 7% and 1%, respectively (LS mean difference = 6%; 95% CI: 3, 10; p<0.001). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks from Study 2. Figure 1: FEV 1 % of Predicted Normal \u2013 Absolute Change from Baseline (Adjusted mean) - ITT Population In Study 2, 9.9% of patients treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and 24.7% of patients who received placebo had unplanned hospitalizations due to the disease. Also in Study 2, 6.2% of patients treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and 16.5% of placebo patients received parenteral tobramycin. FEV1"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body\u2019s defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains , Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species .

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae .

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction and erythema multiforme.

      "WARNINGS Patients treated with tobramycin for injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin for injection, USP is supplied as a sterile white to off-white lyophilized powder or cake and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH between 6.0 and 8.0. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1,200 mg of tobramycin, USP. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin, USP per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is, O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D -ribo- hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5) (salt) and has the molecular formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 )2\u20225H 2 SO 4 .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross - resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram -positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram -negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci .

Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT\u2010RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General - Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Information for Patients \u2014 Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity - Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity - Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment - In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin for injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient\u2019s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function - Adults-With Serious Infections : 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ).

Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis - In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function - Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals - When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. Normal dosage at prolonged intervals - If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients - The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration - For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package Use Aseptic Technique \u2013 Not for Direct Infusion The pharmacy bulk package is for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only. For hanger application, peel off the paper liner from both ends of the tape hanger to expose 3/4 in. long adhesive portions. Adhere each end to the label on the vial. During use, container must be stored and all manipulations performed in an appropriate laminar flow hood. Remove cover from container and cleanse closure with antiseptic. A single entry through the vial closure should be made with a sterile dispensing set which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Transfer individual dose(s) to appropriate intravenous infusion solutions without delay. Use of a syringe with needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. Multiple entries will also increase the potential of microbial and particulate contamination. The above process should be carried out under a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique. ANY UNUSED PORTION MUST BE DISCARDED WITHIN 4 HOURS. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. figure-1"

(2.1) Administer each 300 mg dose by inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* compressor. (2.2) 2.1 Dosage Tobramycin inhalation solution is for oral inhalation only [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . The recommended dosage of tobramycin inhalation solution for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is one single-dose ampule (300 mg) administered twice daily for 28 days. Dosage is not adjusted by weight. All patients should be administered 300 mg twice daily. Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered twice daily in alternating periods of 28 days. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on/28 day off cycle. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible; they should not be taken less than 6 hours apart. If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15-minute period, using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration. Prior to administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for tobramycin inhalation solution for detailed information on how to use tobramycin inhalation solution, and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth. Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications, prior to inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by their physician. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. (5.1) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.3) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. (5.4) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm (5.5, 8.1) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous (IV) tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. (1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen n=258 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen. spl-tobramycin-figure figure 2.jpg"

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Tobramycin inhalation solution is made for inhalation using a PARI LC PLUS\u2122* Reusable Nebulizer and a DeVilbiss \u00ae* Pulmo-Aide \u00ae* air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution can be taken at home, school, or at work. The following instructions tell you how to use the DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* air compressor and PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer to administer tobramycin inhalation solution. You will need the following supplies (See Figure A) : 1 tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* air compressor PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your T obramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure B) . Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally colorless to light yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel.

Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O) . Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. Step 20 : Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide* Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss* Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \u201cOff\u201d position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor. How should I store tobramycin inhalation solution? Store tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) until needed. You may store the tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the foil pouches (opened or unopened) at room temperature 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution ampules if they have been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days. Protect tobramycin inhalation solution ampules from light. Keep tobramycin inhalation solution and all medicines out of the reach of children. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "BOXED WARNING Patients treated with Tobramycin for injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Sterile tobramycin sulfate is supplied as a sterile dry powder and is intended for reconstitution with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin. After reconstitution, the solution will contain 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. The product contains no preservative or sodium bisulfite. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). Tobramycin-Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance : Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) . Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Test: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp , E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulphate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulphate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."

      "PRECAUTIONS General \u2014 Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Category D - Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use - Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). This product does not contain sodium. Information for Patients \u2014Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity \u2014 Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity \u2014 Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fosun Pharma USA Inc. at 1-866-611-3762 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms \u2014The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment \u2014 In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin for injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. This insert is for a Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing I.V. admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular use are for informational purposes only. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function \u2014 Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections : Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 3 DOSAGE SCHEDULE GUIDE FOR TOBRAMYCIN FOR INJECTION, USP IN ADULTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION (Dosage at 8-Hour Intervals) For Patient Weighing Usual Dose for Serious Infections 1 mg/kg q8h (Total, 3mg/kg/day) Maximum Dose for Life-Threatening Infections (Reduce as soon as possible) 1.66 mg/kg q8h (Total, 5 mg/kg/day) kg lb mg/dose* mL/dose* m g/dose mL/dose q8h q8h 120 264 120 mg 3 mL 200 mg 5 mL 115 253 115 mg 2.9 mL 191 mg 4.75 mL 110 242 110 mg 2.75 mL 183 mg 4.5 mL 105 231 105 mg 2.6 mL 175 mg 4.4 mL 100 220 100 mg 2.5 mL 166 mg 4.2 mL 95 209 95 mg 2.4 mL 158 mg 4 mL 90 198 90 mg 2.25 mL 150 mg 3.75 mL 85 187 85 mg 2.1 mL 141 mg 3.5 mL 80 176 80 mg 2 mL 133 mg 3.3 mL 75 165 75 mg 1.9 mL 125 mg 3.1 mL 70 154 70 mg 1.75 mL 116 mg 2.9 mL 65 143 65 mg 1.6 mL 108 mg 2.7 mL 60 132 60 mg 1.5 mL 100 mg 2.5 mL 55 121 55 mg 1.4 mL 91 mg 2.25 mL 50 110 50 mg 1.25 mL 83 mg 2.1 mL 45 99 45 mg 1.1 mL 75 mg 1.9 mL 40 88 40 mg 1 mL 66 mg 1.6 mL *Applicable to all product forms except Tobramycin Injection, USP, 10 mg /mL (Pediatric). Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis \u2014 In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function \u2014 Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients \u2014 The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration \u2014 For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin for injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation and Storage- Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package - Not for Direct Infusion. The pharmacy bulk package is for use in the Hospital Pharmacy Admixture Service and only in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood.

      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin Sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin Injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 10 mg (pediatric) or 40 mg tobramycin; sodium metabisulfite added as an antioxidant 3 mg; and edetate disodium added as a stabilizer, 0.1 mg. Contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. pH 4.0 (3.0 to 6.5). Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine sulfate (2:5)(salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.45. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: structural formula tobramycin sulfate"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin injection is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Resistance Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Interactions With Other Antimicrobials Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Antimicrobial Activity Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacter sp Proteus mirabilis Escherichia coli Proteus vulgaris Klebsiella sp Providencia sp Morganella morganii Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the pediatric patient and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus. Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. Tobramycin Injection, USP contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. General: Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Pregnancy: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tobramycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Pediatric Use: See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use: Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin 80 mg/2 mL vials contain 1.4 mg (0.06 mEq) of sodium."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity: Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity: Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (AST, ALT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.

    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms: The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, pediatric patients given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment: In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tobramycin Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 1). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 1). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 1. Dosage Schedule Guide for Tobramycin Injection, USP in Adults with Normal Renal Function (Dosage at 8-Hour Intervals) For Patient Weighing Usual Dose for Serious Infections Maximum Dose for Life- Threatening Infections (Reduce as soon as possible) 1 mg/kg q8h (Total, 3 mg/kg/day) 1.66 mg/kg q8h (Total, 5 mg/kg/day) mg/dose mL/dose* mg/dose mL/dose* kg lb q8h q8h 120 264 120 mg 3 mL 200 mg 5 mL 115 253 115 mg 2.9 mL 191 mg 4.75 mL 110 242 110 mg 2.75 mL 183 mg 4.5 mL 105 231 105 mg 2.6 mL 175 mg 4.4 mL 100 220 100 mg 2.5 mL 166 mg 4.2 mL 95 209 95 mg 2.4 mL 158 mg 4 mL 90 198 90 mg 2.25 mL 150 mg 3.75 mL 85 187 85 mg 2.1 mL 141 mg 3.5 mL 80 176 80 mg 2 mL 133 mg 3.3 mL 75 165 75 mg 1.9 mL 125 mg 3.1 mL 70 154 70 mg 1.75 mL 116 mg 2.9 mL 65 143 65 mg 1.6 mL 108 mg 2.7 mL 60 132 60 mg 1.5 mL 100 mg 2.5 mL 55 121 55 mg 1.4 mL 91 mg 2.25 mL 50 110 50 mg 1.25 mL 83 mg 2.1 mL 45 99 45 mg 1.1 mL 75 mg 1.9 mL 40 88 40 mg 1 mL 66 mg 1.6 mL * Applicable to all product forms except Tobramycin Injection, USP, 10 mg/mL (Pediatric). Pediatric Patients (Greater Than 1 Week of Age): 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg/kg every 6 hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentration of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to a wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 1 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 1 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intramuscular Administration Tobramycin Injection, USP may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial. Tobramycin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride is not intended for intramuscular administration. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. graphic reduced dosage nomogram"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral inhalation only. ( 2.1 ) The recommended dosage for adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is one single-dose ampule (300 mg) twice daily by oral inhalation in alternating periods of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug. ( 2.1 ) Dosage is not adjusted by weight. ( 2.1 ) Take doses as close to 12 hours apart as possible; but not less than 6 hours apart. ( 2.1 ) Administer each 300 mg dose by inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosage Tobramycin inhalation solution is for oral inhalation only [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dosage of tobramycin inhalation solution for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is one single-dose ampule (300 mg) administered twice daily for 28 days. Dosage is not adjusted by weight. All patients should be administered 300 mg twice daily. Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered twice daily in alternating periods of 28 days. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on/28 day off cycle. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible; they should not be taken less than 6 hours apart. If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15-minute period, using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration. Prior to administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for tobramycin inhalation solution for detailed information on how to use tobramycin inhalation solution and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth. Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications, prior to inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by their physician. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction T o bramyci n Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=2 6 2 ) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution -treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (se e Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. (1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of tobramycin inhalation solution has been completed. Rats were exposed to tobramycin inhalation solution for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. The clinical formulation of the drug was used for this carcinogenicity study. Serum levels of tobramycin of up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, in contrast to the average 1 mcg/mL levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor. Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of i n vitro and in vivo tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with 5 tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test. Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of tobramycin inhalation solution has been completed. Rats were exposed to tobramycin inhalation solution for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. The clinical formulation of the drug was used for this carcinogenicity study. Serum levels of tobramycin of up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, in contrast to the average 1 mcg/mL levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor. Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of i n vitro and in vivo tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with 5 tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days T obramycin Inhalation Solution regimen n=258 T obramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug T obramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug T obramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution -treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

You will need the following supplies (See Figure A): 1 Tobramycin inhalation solution plastic ampule (Tobramycin inhalation solution is packaged with 4 ampules in each foil pouch) DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae air compressor PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer Tubing to connect the nebulizer and compressor Clean paper or cloth towels Nose clips (optional) (Figure A) It is important that your nebulizer and compressor function properly before starting your tobramycin inhalation solution therapy. Note: Read the manufacturer care and use instructions for important information. Prepare Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for Inhalation Therapy Step 1: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Step 2: Open the foil pouch. Step 3: Separate 1 tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs ( See Figure B ). Place the remaining tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in the refrigerator. (Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule ( See Figure C ). Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS\u2122 Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts ( See Figure D ): Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off ( See Figure E ). (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel ( See Figure F ). (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet ( See Figure G ). The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet ( See Figure H ). (Figure H) Step 11: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand ( See Figure I ). Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. (Figure I) Step 12: Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup ( See Figure J ). (Figure J) Step 13: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the Nebulizer Cup ( See Figure K ). (Figure K) Step 14: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet ( See Figure L ). (Figure L) Step 15: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top ( See Figure M ). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. (Figure M) Step 16: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup ( See Figure N ). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. (Figure N) Giving Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 17: Turn on the compressor ( See Figure O ). (Figure O) Step 18: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece ( See Figure P ). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. (Figure P) Step 19: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth ( See Figure Q ). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. (Figure Q) Step 20: Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After Your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. 1) Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. 2) Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. 3) Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. 4) Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). 1) Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. 2) Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. 3) Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide \u00ae Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss \u00ae Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \"Off\" position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor. How Should I Store Tobramycin Inhalation Solution?

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR EYE USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body\u2019s defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains , Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species .

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae .

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions, such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

    "nursing_mothers": [
      "Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction and erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch & Lomb Incorporated at 1-800-553-5340 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosage Tobramycin inhalation solution is for oral inhalation only [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The recommended dosage of tobramycin inhalation solution for patients six years of age and older is to administer one single-dose ampule (300 mg/4 mL) twice daily by oral inhalation in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible and not less than 6 hours apart. The 300 mg/4 mL dose of tobramycin inhalation solution is the same for patients regardless of age or weight. Tobramycin inhalation solution has not been studied in patients less than six years old. If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a PARI Vios Air compressor over an approximately 15 minute period and until sputtering from the output of the nebulizer has occurred for at least one minute. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous, or intrathecal administration. Further patient instructions on how to administer tobramycin inhalation solution are provided in the Patient\u2019s Instructions for Use [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory, vestibular, renal, or neuromuscular dysfunction. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 and 5.5 ) Aminoglycoside may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. ( 5.3 ) Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin. ( 5.4 ) Audiograms, serum concentration, and renal function should be monitored as appropriate. ( 5.2 and 5.5 ) Fetal harm can occur when aminoglycosides are administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of the potential hazard to the fetus. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials. Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies. Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the tobramycin inhalation solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity. No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] , onset of this symptom warrants caution. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.2 Nephrotoxicity Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity was not seen during tobramycin inhalation solution clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL. Twenty-six (14%) tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 tobramycin inhalation solution patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution should have their renal function closely monitored. 5.3 Neuromuscular Disorders Tobramycin inhalation solution should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.4 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.5 Laboratory Tests Audiograms Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution. Serum Concentrations In patients with normal renal function treated with tobramycin inhalation solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06 to 1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing. Renal Function The clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the tobramycin inhalation solution group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.7 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions (more than 5%) occurring more frequently in tobramycin inhalation solution patients are forced expiratory volume decreased, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drugs cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to tobramycin inhalation solution in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution ranged in age from 6 to 31 years. In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug. All patients were \u226430 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13 to 17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (>17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the tobramycin inhalation solution group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders. In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were \u226446 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6 to 12 years old while 29% of patients were 13 to 17 years old. Only 30% were adults (>17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa . Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa during the study. More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and at rates \u2265 2% more common compared to the placebo-treated patients: decreased forced expiratory volume, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia (Table 1).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to a mother. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Although there are no available data on use of tobramycin inhalation solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u2265 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production following oral inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution have not been studied in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients under six years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the exposure of tobramycin. The risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with serum creatinine > 2mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 40mg/dL have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.5 )] . Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Although there are no available data on use of tobramycin inhalation solution in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes.

Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin inhalation solution is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. 1 The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. 2 Sputum Concentrations Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes. After four weeks of therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa . It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin. Cross Resistance Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable. Development of Resistance Treatment for six months with tobramycin inhalation solution in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Susceptibility Testing The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial. Susceptibility Testing Techniques Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods can be used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tobramycin that will inhibit the growth of the bacteria being tested. The MIC provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. The MIC should be determined using a standardized procedure. 3, 5 Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. 4, 5 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of tobramycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to tobramycin. Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria In vitro susceptibility test interpretive criteria for inhaled tobramycin have not been determined. The relation of the in vitro MIC and/or disk diffusion susceptibility test results to clinical efficacy of inhaled tobramycin against the bacteria tested should be monitored. Quality Control Parameters for Susceptibility Testing In vitro susceptibility test quality control parameters exist for tobramycin so that laboratories that test the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tobramycin can determine if the susceptibility test is performing correctly. Standardized dilution techniques and diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tobramycin powder should provide the following MIC and a 10 mcg tobramycin disk should produce the following zone diameters with the indicated quality control strains (Table 2). Table 2: Acceptable Quality Control Ranges for Tobramycin Bacteria MIC Range (mcg/mL) Disk Diffusion Zone Diameter (mm) Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 0.25 to 1 19 to 25 Other No trends in the treatment-emergent isolation of other bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, or Staphylococcus aureus were observed in clinical trials of tobramycin inhalation solution relative to placebo. There was a slight increase in isolation of Candida spp in sputum at the end of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment cycle in clinical trials."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to tobramycin inhalation solution over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies. The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with tobramycin inhalation solution. In vitro cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed tobramycin inhalation solution and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer). All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV 1 % predicted \u226540% and \u226480% (mean baseline FEV 1 of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of \u22651.5 mg/dL, or who had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received tobramycin inhalation solution, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than P. aeruginosa . Study 1 Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive tobramycin inhalation solution (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were \u226430 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis except for one patient who had missing baseline information. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 1 dosing in the primary analysis population. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 16% and 5%, respectively (LS mean difference = 11%; 95% CI: 3, 19; p=0.003). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over eight weeks. Study 2 Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-cycle, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 247 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three cycles of tobramycin inhalation solution (n=161) or placebo (n=86). As in Study 1, each cycle comprised 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. All patients were \u226446 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 44.9% were females. In this study, two randomized patients in the placebo group were not included in the primary efficacy analysis; one withdrew consent without taking any trial medication and the other withdrew due to an adverse drug reaction. Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 3 \u201cON\u201d period. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV 1 % predicted of 7% and 1%, respectively (LS mean difference = 6%; 95% CI: 3, 10; p<0.001). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV 1 % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks from Study 2.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information and Instructions for Use ). Information for Patients Information on the long term efficacy and safety of tobramycin inhalation solution is limited. There is no information in patients with severe cystic fibrosis (FEV 1 <40% predicted). Patients should be advised to complete a full 28-day course of tobramycin inhalation solution, even if they are feeling better. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop tobramycin inhalation solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on and 28 day off cycle. For patients taking several different inhaled medications and/or performing chest physiotherapy, advise the patient regarding the order they should take the therapies. It is recommended that tobramycin inhalation solution be taken last. Tobramycin inhalation solution is to be used with the PARI LC PLUS reusable nebulizer and the PARI VIOS air compressor. Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for care and use of the nebulizer and compressor. 17.1 Ototoxicity Inform patients that ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or tinnitus, was reported by patients treated with tobramycin. Physicians should consider an audiogram at baseline, particularly for patients at increased risk of auditory dysfunction. If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during tobramycin inhalation solution therapy, the physician should refer that patient for audiological assessment.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE-Not for Direct Infusion: Dispense single doses to many patients in a pharmacy admixture program. Pharmacy bulk package vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration ( 2.1 , 2.8 ) Recommended adult dosages are as follows: Serious Infections: Administer 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses (i.e. 1 mg/kg every 8 hours) Life-threatening Infections: Administer up to 5 mg/kg in 3 or 4 equal doses See full prescribing information for the recommended dosage for pediatric patients ( 2.3 ), patients with cystic fibrosis ( 2.5 ), patients with renal impairment ( 2.6 ), and obese patients ( 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Pharmacy Bulk Package-Not for Direct Infusion Tobramycin for Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package is intended for dispensing of single doses to many patients in a hospital pharmacy admixture service. It should only be prepared in an aseptic work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Tobramycin for Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 )] . After reconstitution, the closure may be penetrated only one time using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set, which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. After penetration, the entire contents of the bulk vial must be dispensed within 24 hours. Do not administer Tobramycin for Injection as a direct, undiluted intravenous injection. 2.2 Dosage for Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Tobramycin for Injection may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The recommended dosage is as follows: Adult Patients Adults with Serious Infections 3 mg/kg/day administered in 3 equal doses of 1 mg/kg every 8 hours. Adults with Life-Threatening Infections Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 1 ). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive serum concentrations, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum concentrations are monitored [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Table 1 DOSAGE SCHEDULE GUIDE FOR ADULTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION (Dosage at 8-Hour Intervals) For Patient Weighing Usual Dose for Serious Infections 1 mg/kg Every 8 hours (h) kg lb (Total, 3 mg/kg/day) mg/dose mL/dose* q8h 120 264 120 mg 3 mL 115 253 115 mg 2.9 mL 110 242 110 mg 2.75 mL 105 231 105 mg 2.6 mL 100 220 100 mg 2.5 mL 95 209 95 mg 2.4 mL 90 198 90 mg 2.25 mL 85 187 85 mg 2.1 mL 80 176 80 mg 2 mL 75 165 75 mg 1.9 mL 70 154 70 mg 1.75 mL 65 143 65 mg 1.6 mL 60 132 60 mg 1.5 mL 55 121 55 mg 1.4 mL 50 110 50 mg 1.25 mL 45 99 45 mg 1.1 mL 40 88 40 mg 1 mL *Applicable to all product forms except the Tobramycin Injection, USP, (Pediatric).

Premature or Full-Term Neonates (1 Week of Age or Less): Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. 2.4 Duration of Treatment for Adult and Pediatric Patients The usual duration of treatment for adult and pediatric patients is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. 2.5 Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis or Burns In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. An initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is suggested as a guide. The serum concentrations of tobramycin should be monitored during treatment due to wide inter-patient variability. Similarly, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations in patients with extensive burns. Monitoring tobramycin serum concentration in these patients is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 2.6 Dosage for Patients with Renal Impairment Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides and dose should be adjusted based on serum concentration. The dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and serum tobramycin concentration monitoring and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals When the creatinine clearance rate is less than or equal to 70 mL per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose in adult patients from Table 1 by the percent of the normal dosage from the accompanying nomogram in Figure 1 below. Figure 1: NOMOGRAM Figure 1 Normal dosage at prolonged intervals If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the recommended adult dose can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. 2.7 Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the weight on which to determine the dose in mg/kg. 2.8 Instructions for Preparation and Intravenous Administration Tobramycin for Injection is supplied as a dry powder in a pharmacy bulk package vial that contains the equivalent of 1.2 g of tobramycin. The contents of the vial must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration as follows: Reconstitute the contents of the pharmacy bulk package vial aseptically with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP to provide a reconstituted solution containing 40 mg of tobramycin per mL. Dilute the reconstituted pharmacy bulk vial prior to intravenous administration by adding a specified volume of the reconstituted solution to 50 to 100 mL (for adult doses) of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) for each patient. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. After penetration, entire contents of pharmacy bulk vial should be dispensed within 24 hours. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration The diluted solution should be intravenously infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Intravenous infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum concentrations may exceed 12 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 2.9 Measurement of Serum Concentrations of Tobramycin Measure peak and trough serum tobramycin concentrations periodically during therapy to assure adequate concentrations and to avoid potentially toxic concentrations in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Avoid peak serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL. Rising trough concentrations (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation may result in ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . A useful guideline is to measure serum concentrations after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, obtain more frequent serum tobramycin concentrations and adjust the dosage or dosage interval according to the guidelines provided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. In order to measure the peak concentration, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough concentrations are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-concentration assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less susceptible organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. 2.10 Drug Incompatibilities Tobramycin should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity: See Boxed Warning ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Allergic Reactions: anaphylaxis, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported in patients on Tobramycin for Injection therapy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy ( 5.4 ) Neuromuscular Blockade: Respiratory paralysis can occur at high doses or with concurrent use of neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, consider administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.5 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Nephrotoxicity Systemic exposure to Tobramycin for Injection and other aminoglycosides can cause nephrotoxicity, primarily manifested as acute tubular necrosis. Signs of nephrotoxicity include rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), decreased urinary output, and sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, phosphate and calcium urinary losses. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity may occur during therapy but may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy and usually is reversible. The risk for nephrotoxicity increases with tobramycin accumulation (indicated by rising trough levels above 2 mcg/mL), excessive peak concentrations (above 12 mcg/mL), total cumulative dose, advanced age, volume depletion, concurrent or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs and in patients with diabetes. Monitor serum tobramycin concentrations in all patients and avoid peak levels above 12 mcg/mL and trough levels above 2 mcg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Monitor renal function, serum electrolytes, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate, urine output and urinalysis during therapy in all patients. Reduce the dose or discontinue treatment if renal impairment occurs. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin for Injection Tobramycin for Injection can cause both auditory and vestibular eighth nerve damage. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Symptoms of ototoxicity can include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears and hearing loss. Ototoxicity symptoms may manifest during therapy or after tobramycin has been discontinued. The risk of ototoxicity increases with higher peak and trough serum tobramycin concentrations, in patients who receive high doses or prolonged or prior treatment with tobramycin or other aminoglycosides, in patients with renal impairment, patients receiving with other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs and in the extremes of age. To decrease the risk of ototoxicity, use as short a duration of therapy as clinically appropriate, adequately hydrate patients, limit the use of other ototoxic drugs, and closely monitor tobramycin concentrations during therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of auditory or vestibular toxicity and consider serial audiograms in high-risk patients. Discontinue tobramycin in patients with evidence of auditory or vestibular toxicity. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta. Streptomycin, another aminoglycoside, has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Apprise patients of potential hazard to the fetus if Tobramycin for Injection is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Tobramycin for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.4 Allergic Reactions Serious and fatal allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported in patients on tobramycin therapy [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue Tobramycin for Injection and institute appropriate therapy. A history of hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides is a contraindication to the use of Tobramycin for Injection, because cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.5 Neuromuscular Blockade and Other Neurologic Adverse Reactions Neuromuscular blockade with respiratory paralysis and respiratory failure may occur following administration of aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly and be more severe in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease and in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs following the administration of Tobramycin for Injection, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin for Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Risk of Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Tobramycin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Macular Necrosis Tobramycin for Injection is not approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Macular necrosis has been reported following intraocular and/ or subconjunctival administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin. 5.9 Inactivation by Beta-Lactam Antibacterials The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibacterials (penicillins, cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes at doses up to 3.2 times and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively. Data Animal Data Subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (rat) or 20 mg/kg/day (rabbit) during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. These doses are 3.2 and 1.3 times the maximum recommended clinical daily dose of 5 mg/kg based on body surface area. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published data with Tobramycin for Injection in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of Tobramycin for Injection on milk production. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tobramycin for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tobramycin for Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Use Tobramycin for Injection with caution in premature infants and neonates because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life. For pediatric dosing information [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Similar to adults, monitor renal function and serum tobramycin concentrations in pediatric patients receiving Tobramycin for Injection. 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving Tobramycin for Injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function and serum tobramycin levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment The dosage schedule of Tobramycin for Injection should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment and serum concentration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms Acute overdosage with Tobramycin for Injection can result in more severe manifestations of the types of toxicities known to occur with recommended doses, e.g., renal damage, ototoxicity, neuromuscular blockade. The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.5 )] for signs and symptoms related to neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade; and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are minimally absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. 10.2 Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage with Tobramycin for Injection, call your Regional Poison Control Center or the National Poison Control center at 1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. Management of Tobramycin for Injection overdosage is symptomatic and supportive. Maintain airway, provide adequate hydration and monitor renal function, serum electrolytes, and tobramycin concentrations until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Tobramycin is removed by hemodialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibacterial drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in serum. The serum elimination half-life in patients with normal renal function is 2 hours. However, in patients with renal impairment and in neonates, serum concentrations of the antibacterial are usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in adults with normal renal function. Thus, the dosage of Tobramycin for Injection for patients with renal impairment and neonates must be adjusted accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.6 )]. Absorption Following intramuscular administration, peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable concentrations persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum concentrations are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When Tobramycin for Injection is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution Based on ultrafiltration studies, practically no serum protein binding of tobramycin occurs. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations of tobramycin in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimal biliary excretion. The concentration of tobramycin in cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration is low, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. Tobramycin has also been detected in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than serum concentrations. Metabolism Following parenteral administration, minimal, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Excretion Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood concentrations. Drug Interactions Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the aminoacyl site (A) of the 16S RNA within the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Tobramycin is bactericidal against susceptible bacteria. Resistance Resistance to aminoglycosides includes production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs), alteration of the ribosomal target through production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases, up-regulation of efflux pumps and reduced permeability into bacterial cell due to loss of outer membrane porins. Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibacterial that interferes with cell-wall synthesis, such as penicillin, results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in some isolates of Enterococcus faecalis . This combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium. Species-level identification of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibacterial synergism must be performed. Antimicrobial Activity Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] : Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter species Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia species Serratia species Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Allergic Reactions Advise patients that serious allergic reactions could occur with Tobramycin for Injection. Advise patients to report fever, swelling, difficulty breathing, wheezing, decrease blood pressure or dizziness, or skin rash. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy immediately. Impairment of Kidney Function Advise patients that Tobramycin for Injection may cause impairment in kidney function and that periodic blood draws are required to monitor kidney function and tobramycin drug levels. Hearing Loss and Impaired Balance Advise patients that Tobramycin for Injection may cause serious and irreversible hearing loss and impaired balance. Advise patients to report hearing loss, ringing or roaring in the ears, dizziness or imbalance. Antibacterial Resistance Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including Tobramycin for Injection should be used to treat bacterial infections only. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Tobramycin for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be administered exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Tobramycin for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Embryofetal Toxicity Advise pregnant women that aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin for Injection, can cause irreversible congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Lactation Advise a woman to monitor their breastfed infants for diarrhea and/or bloody stools [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )].

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having pre-existing renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION: Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin Injection, USP is a clear and colorless sterile aqueous solution for parenteral administration. Each mL contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 10 mg (pediatric) or 40 mg tobramycin; phenol added as preservative, 5 mg; sodium metabisulfite added as an antioxidant, 3.2 mg; and edetate sodium added as a stabilizer, 0.1 mg. Contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment (3.0 to 6.5). Each mL of tobramycin (10 mg/mL or 40 mg/mL) contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy- \u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.42. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: Structural Formula for Tobramycin"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half- life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Antimicrobial Activity: Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. Susceptibility Tests: For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginos a, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus. Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Each mL of tobramycin (10 mg/mL or 40 mg/mL) contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and also at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less sensitive organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns or cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u00df-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated."

      "Pregnancy Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus."

Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to tobramycin include increased serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT); increased serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and leukopenia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE: Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient's renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity, as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Tobramycin Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Recommended dosages are the same for both routes. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults with Serious Infections: 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3 ). Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3 ). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Table 3.

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less: Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-hour Intervals \u2014 When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady- state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals \u2014 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6. Figure Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intramuscular Administration Tobramycin may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

Streptococci, including some of the Group A-betahemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. Bacterial susceptibility studies demonstrate that in some cases, microorganisms resistant to gentamicin retain susceptibility to tobramycin. A significant bacterial population resistant to tobramycin has not yet emerged; however, bacterial resistance may develop upon prolonged use."

      "PRECAUTIONS: General: As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Information for patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in three types of animals at doses up to thirty-three times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother."

Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary ( 5.4 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. In postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Patients who use TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Ototoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] The most common adverse reactions (> 5%) in patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 1-844-548-2247 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two clinical studies in 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Adverse reactions reported in these studies are described below: The most frequent adverse reactions in the tobramycin inhalation arm were cough, pharyngitis, and increased sputum (see Table 1 ). Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in > 5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase III studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients with Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and labyrinth disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Although there are no available data on TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution have not been studied in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tobramycin inhalation solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. 1 The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. 2 Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (ranging from 35 to 7414 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (ranging from 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 hours after intravenous (IV) administration. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following IV administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is likely eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. 3 Tobramycin has in vitro activity against Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at peak concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Susceptibility Testing Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. 4,5,6 If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin.

Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of > 2 mg/dL, or had B. cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2 ) using a PARI LC PLUS nebulizer along with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.

In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figure 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle. (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, 4 tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265 128 \u03bcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.

Step 11: Plug your compressor into an electrical outlet (See Figure M ). Step 12: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing straight up onto the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure N ). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. Giving your TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK dose: Step 13: Turn on the compressor (See Figure O ). You should see a steady mist coming from the Mouthpiece (See Figure P ) . Step 14: Sit or stand in a comfortable, upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure Q ). Nose clips may help you breathe only through your mouth and not through your nose. Step 15: Keep breathing in your TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK dose for at least 15 minutes. You will know that you have received your full dose of medicine when you hear a \u201csputtering noise\u201d coming from the Mouthpiece for at least 1 minute and the Nebulizer Cup is empty. After your TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK dose: Step 16: Clean and disinfect your nebulizer (see manufacturer's Instructions for Use). Care and Use of your DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for care and use of your compressor. How should I store TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK? Store tobramycin inhalation solution in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) until needed. You may store the tobramycin inhalation solution in the foil pouches (opened or unopened) at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) for up to 28 days. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution after the expiration date stamped on the ampule. Keep tobramycin inhalation solution in the foil pouch and out of the light. Tobramycin inhalation solution is normally slightly yellow, but may get darker with age if unrefrigerated. The color change does not change how the medicine works. Do not use tobramycin inhalation solution if it is cloudy, has particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days. Throw the applicable ampule(s) away in your household trash and get a new ampule. Keep TOBRAMYCIN INHALATION SOLUTION PAK and all medicines out of the reach of children.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci , including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci , including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone : Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides : Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3%) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.",

Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit.",
      "6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by inhalation. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin.",

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.

In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. Figur e 1: Relative Change From Baseline in FEV 1 % Predicted In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Absolute Change From Baseline in Log 10 CFUs Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ritedose Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-855-806-3300 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients 1 Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38.0 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased 1 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and labyrinth disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Myalgia Infections and infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen n=258 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b2 2 -agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME \u00ae , Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

(Figure B) Step 4: Check the expiration date stamped on the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule (See Figure C) . Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the expiration date has passed. (Figure C) Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing (Figure D) Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E) . (Figure E) Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F) . (Figure F) Step 9: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure G) . The tubing should fit tightly. (Figure G) Step 10: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure H) .

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNINGS Patients treated with Tobramycin for Injection, USP and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur. The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy. Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible. Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS ). Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS )."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Tobramycin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived from the actinomycete Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin for Injection, USP is a white or off-white lyophilized porous cake for parenteral administration. Each vial contains tobramycin sulfate equivalent to 1200 mg of tobramycin; After reconstitution, each mL contains 40 mg of tobramycin, contains sulfuric acid and may contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, (2:5)(salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u20225H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). structural-formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp. Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms. Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus . Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacter sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See WARNINGS box above. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens Johnson Syndrome have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing tobramycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box. Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy. Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment. A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or the dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection. Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin. These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices. It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution. These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less susceptible organisms or those receiving maximum dosage. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported in cats receiving very high doses of tobramycin (40 mg/kg). The possibility of prolonged or secondary apnea should be considered if tobramycin is administered to anesthetized patients who are also receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or to patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with tobramycin, measurement of serum concentration is especially important as a basis for determination of appropriate dosage. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in such patients. An increased incidence of nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism, since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Aminoglycosides may be absorbed in significant quantities from body surfaces after local irrigation or application and may cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides have not been approved for intraocular and/or subconjunctival use. Physicians are advised that macular necrosis has been reported following administration of aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, by these routes. See WARNINGS box regarding concurrent use of potent diuretics and concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. The inactivation of tobramycin and other aminoglycosides by \u03b2-lactam-type antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins) has been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with severe renal impairment. Such inactivation has not been found in patients with normal renal function who have been given the drugs by separate routes of administration. Therapy with tobramycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and OVERDOSAGE ). Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose. Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tobramycin 40 mg/mL in 50 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package vial contains 35.995 mg (1.565 mEq) of sodium. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When an antibacterial drug product is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurotoxicity Adverse effects on both the vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been noted, especially in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy, in those given previous courses of therapy with an ototoxin, and in cases of dehydration. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually irreversible and is manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Tobramycin and gentamicin sulfates closely parallel each other in regard to ototoxic potential. Nephrotoxicity Renal function changes, as shown by rising BUN, NPN, and serum creatinine and by oliguria, cylindruria, and increased proteinuria, have been reported, especially in patients with a history of renal impairment who are treated for longer periods or with higher doses than those recommended. Adverse renal effects can occur in patients with initially normal renal function. Clinical studies and studies in experimental animals have been conducted to compare the nephrotoxic potential of tobramycin and gentamicin. In some of the clinical studies and in the animal studies, tobramycin caused nephrotoxicity significantly less frequently than gentamicin. In some other clinical studies, no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin was found. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to tobramycin sulfate include anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; and fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, lethargy, pain at the injection site, mental confusion, and disorientation.

    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient\u2019s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicity has been associated with aminoglycoside overdose; these toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdose may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and who have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial."

It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ). Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults With Serious Infections 3 mg/kg/day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 3 ). Adults With Life-Threatening Infections Up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 3 ). The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS ).

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced Dosage at 8-Hour Intervals When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient\u2019s serum creatinine. reduced-dosage-nomogram Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient\u2019s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient\u2019s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient\u2019s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see Warnings box). Tobramycin for Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package Use Aseptic Technique \u2013 Not for Direct Infusion The pharmacy bulk package is for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only. During use, container must be stored and all manipulations performed in an appropriate laminar flow hood. Remove cover from container and cleanse closure with antiseptic. A single entry through the vial closure should be made with a sterile dispensing set which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Transfer individual dose(s) to appropriate intravenous infusion solutions without delay. Use of a syringe with needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. Multiple entries will also increase the potential of microbial and particulate contamination. The above process should be carried out under a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique. ANY UNUSED PORTION MUST BE DISCARDED WITHIN 4 HOURS. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose. 2.2 Administration Instructions Tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15-minute period, using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration. Prior to administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for tobramycin inhalation solution for detailed information on how to use tobramycin inhalation solution, and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* air compressor. Tobramycin inhalation solution is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth. Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications, prior to inhaling tobramycin inhalation solution or as directed by their physician. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. (5.1) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. (5.3) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. (5.4) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm (5.5 , 8.1) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are increased cough, pharyngitis, increased sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, voice alteration, taste perversion and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies. Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients Adverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (n=258) % Placebo (n=262) % Cough Increased 46.1 47.3 Pharyngitis 38 39.3 Sputum Increased 37.6 39.7 Dyspnea 33.7 38.5 Hemoptysis 19.4 23.7 Lung Function Decreased Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration. 16.3 15.3 Voice Alteration 12.8 6.5 Taste Perversion 6.6 6.9 Rash 5.4 6.1 Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia, dysgeusia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin inhalation solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa . Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV 1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss* Pulmo-Aide* compressor. Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen n=258 Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg twice daily No drug Placebo regimen n=262 placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug placebo twice daily No drug All patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

Step 5: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUS* Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure C) : Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing Figure C Step 6: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure D). Figure D Step 7: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure E). Figure E Step 8: Connect one end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet (See Figure F). The tubing should fit tightly. Figure F Step 9: Plug in your compressor to an electrical outlet (See Figure G) . Figure G Step 10: Open the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule by holding the bottom tab with 1 hand and twisting off the top of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule with the other hand (See Figure H). Be careful not to squeeze the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule until you are ready to empty all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup. Figure H Step 11: Squeeze all the medicine of the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure I) . Figure I Step 12: Replace the Nebulizer Top. To replace the Nebulizer Top insert the Nebulizer Top into the Nebulizer Cup with the semi-circle halfway down the stem of the Nebulizer Top facing the Nebulizer Outlet. Turn the Nebulizer Top clockwise until securely fastened to the nebulizer Cup. (See Figure J). Figure J Step 13: Push the Mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Outlet (See Figure K). Figure K Step 14: Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Top (See Figure L). The Inspiratory Valve Cap will fit tightly. Figure L Step 15: Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing from the compressor to the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure M). Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright. Figure M Giving your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Step 16: Turn on the compressor (See Figure N). Figure N Step 17: Check for a steady mist from the Mouthpiece (See Figure O). If there is no mist, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working properly. Figure O Step 18: Sit or stand in an upright position that will allow you to breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure P). Nose clips may help you breathe through your mouth and not through your nose. Do not block the airflow with your tongue. Figure P Step 19: Keep breathing in your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine for at least 15 minutes to get your full dose. Continue therapy until all your tobramycin inhalation solution medicine is gone, and there is no longer any mist being made. You may hear a sputtering sound coming from the Mouthpiece when the Nebulizer Cup is empty. The entire tobramycin inhalation solution therapy should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are interrupted, need to cough or rest during your tobramycin inhalation solution treatment, turn off the compressor to save your medicine. Turn the compressor back on when you are ready to restart your treatment. Follow the nebulizer cleaning and disinfecting instructions after completing your therapy. After your Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Inhalation Therapy Cleaning Your Nebulizer To reduce the risk of infection, illness or injury from contamination, you must thoroughly clean all parts of the nebulizer as instructed after each treatment. Never use a nebulizer with a clogged nozzle. If the nozzle is clogged, no aerosol mist is made, and your therapy will not be as effective. Replace the nebulizer if clogging occurs. Remove tubing from nebulizer and disassemble nebulizer parts. Wash all parts (except tubing) with warm water and liquid dish soap. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and shake out water. Air dry or hand dry nebulizer parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Reassemble nebulizer when dry, and store. You can also wash all parts of the nebulizer in a dishwasher (except tubing). Place the nebulizer parts in a dishwasher basket. Place the dishwasher basket on the top rack of the dishwasher. Remove and dry the parts when the cycle is complete. Disinfecting Your Nebulizer Your nebulizer is for your use only. Do not share your nebulizer with other people. You must disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day. Failure to disinfect the nebulizer every other treatment day could lead to serious or fatal illness. Clean the nebulizer as described above. Every other treatment day, disinfect the nebulizer parts (except tubing) by boiling them in water for a full 10 minutes. Dry parts on a clean, lint-free cloth. Care and Use of Your Pulmo-Aide* Compressor Follow the manufacturer instructions for care and use of your compressor. Filter Change: DeVilbiss* Compressor filters should be changed every 6 months or sooner if the filter turns completely gray in color. Compressor Cleaning: With power switch in the \u201cOff\u201d position, unplug power cord from wall outlet. Wipe outside of the compressor cabinet with a clean, damp cloth every few days to keep dust free. Caution: Do not submerge in water because this will damage the compressor.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid. The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication."
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. PRECAUTIONS: General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available. The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (tobramycin ophthalmic solution) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Postmarketing Experience: Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components listed below: Dexamethasone: Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.2 ) Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. ( 5.3 ) Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare\u2010like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV 1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate. 5.2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin inhalation solution Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1) , particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution. 5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. 5.5 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored."

Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution: Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty- three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery. Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with tobramycin inhalation solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tobramycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of tobramycin inhalation solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body."

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius .(1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death.(3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin."

Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded. All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS \u2122 Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss \u00ae Pulmo-Aide \u00ae compressor.

In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech). In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV 1 % predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV 1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies. In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2). Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However, four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial with P. aeruginosa isolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV 1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some P. aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.

Step 5: Check that the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule medicine is clear and does not have particles. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally slightly yellow, may darken with age. This color change does not mean there is any change in the quality of the medicine. Do not use the tobramycin inhalation solution ampule if the medicine is cloudy or has particles. Throw it away and get a new one. Step 6: Lay out the parts of a PARI LC PLUSTM Reusable Nebulizer package on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. You should have the following parts (See Figure D): Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly Inspiratory Valve Cap Mouthpiece with Valve Tubing Step 7: Remove the Nebulizer Top from the Nebulizer Cup by twisting the Nebulizer Top counter-clockwise, and then lifting off (See Figure E) . Step 8: Place the Nebulizer Top on the clean paper or cloth towel by standing the Nebulizer Cup upright on the towel (See Figure F).
