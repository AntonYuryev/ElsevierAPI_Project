    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: A moderately long-acting mydriatic and cycloplegic for cycloplegic refraction and in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the uveal tract. For pre and postoperative states when mydriasis is required. Use as an optical aid in some cases of axial lens opacities."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: For refraction, instill one or two drops topically in the eye(s). May be repeated in five or ten minutes if necessary. For uveitis, instill one or two drops topically up to every three to four hours. Individuals with heavily pigmented irides may require larger doses."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Contraindicated in persons with primary glaucoma or a tendency toward glaucoma, e.g. narrow anterior chamber angle, and in those persons showing hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING: For topical use only \u2013 not for injection. Risk-benefit should be considered when the following medical problems exist: keratoconus (Homatropine may produce fixed dilated pupil); Down\u2019s syndrome, children with brain damage and the elderly (increased susceptibility). In infants and small children, use with extreme caution. Excessive use in pediatric patients or certain individuals with a history of susceptibility to belladonna alkaloids may produce systemic symptoms of homatropine poisoning (see overdose section )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General. To avoid excessive systemic absorption, the lacrimal sac should be compressed by digital pressure for two to three minutes after installation. To avoid inducing angle closure glaucoma, an estimation of the depth of the angle of the anterior chamber should be made. Excessive topical use of this drug can potentially lead to a confusional state characterized by delirium, agitation, and rarely coma. This state is more apt to occur in the pediatric and geriatric age groups. The specific anti-dote for this systemic anticholinergic syndrome is injectable physostigmine salicylate. Information to Patients. Patient should be advised not to drive or engage in other hazardous activities while pupils are dilated. Patient may experience sensitivity to light and should protect eyes in bright illumination during dilation. Parents should be warned not to get this preparation in their child\u2019s mouth and to wash their own hands and the child\u2019s hands following administration. Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution."
