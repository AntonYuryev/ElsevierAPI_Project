      "CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Isotretinoin capsules must not be used by patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin capsules in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects which have been documented following isotretinoin capsules exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include: skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include: CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Special Prescribing Requirements Because of isotretinoin teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, isotretinoin capsules approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This REMS is called iPLEDGE \u00ae . Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsule s must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. 1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 \u00d7 40 mg capsules) of isotretinoin under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with isotretinoin given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, isotretinoin should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N=74 Isotretinoin 2\u00d740 mg Capsules AUC 0\u2013\u221e (ng\u2219hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t 1/2 (hr) Fed Eating a standardized high-fat meal. 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u226518 years), the exposure of patients to 4-oxo-isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1SD elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients (\u226518 years) who received isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4- oxo- isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed. The dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients. Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Following Single and Multiple Dose Administration in Pediatric Patients, 12 to 15 Years of Age Mean (\u00b1 SD), N=38 The single and multiple dose data in this table were obtained following a non-standardized meal that is not comparable to the high-fat meal that was used in the study in Table 2.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Isotretinoin capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. \"Severe,\" by definition, 2 means \"many\" as opposed to \"few or several\" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, isotretinoin capsules should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, isotretinoin capsules are indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because isotretinoin capsules can cause life-threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin capsules. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density , Hyperostosis , Premature Epiphyseal Closure )."

      "WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin capsules may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (\"Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults\"), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological ). Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dL have been reported in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25% of patients receiving isotretinoin capsules in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15% developed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL, and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing isotretinoin capsules. 5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before isotretinoin capsules are given and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to risk/benefit for patients who may be at high risk during isotretinoin capsules therapy (patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin capsules therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin capsules are unknown. Animal Studies In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin capsules; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to isotretinoin capsules therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin capsules have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin capsules treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal ). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density >5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13\u201318 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures, and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the isotretinoin capsules population. While causality to isotretinoin capsules have not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization. 6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x\u2013ray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin capsules treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All isotretinoin capsules patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin capsules therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night."

      "PRECAUTIONS Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Enrolled and activated pharmacies must receive isotretinoin capsules only from wholesalers enrolled with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE REMS requirements for wholesalers, prescribers, and pharmacists are described below: Wholesalers For the purpose of the iPLEDGE REMS, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor, and/or chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute isotretinoin capsules, wholesalers must be enrolled with iPLEDGE, and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must enroll with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include: Enrolling prior to distributing isotretinoin and re-enrolling annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to wholesalers enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS with prior written consent from the manufacturer or pharmacies licensed in the US and enrolled and activated in the iPLEDGE REMS Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any non-enrolled and/or non-activated pharmacy or unenrolled wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE REMS by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if the wholesaler is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the wholesaler chooses to not re-enroll annually Prescribers To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling, or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide. Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin, and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any patient who can become pregnant until verifying the patient has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the patient who can become pregnant is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) to: Register each patient in the iPLEDGE REMS. Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education . For patients who can become pregnant: Enter patient's two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the enrolled patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS. Meeting the requirements for a patient who can become pregnant signifies that the patient: Has been counseled and has signed a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time one month before, during, or one month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin capsules immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming isotretinoin capsules therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether the patient has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception: Primary forms Secondary forms tubal sterilization male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables, or vaginal ring) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products; these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking isotretinoin capsules. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single form of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive warnings about the rates of possible contraception failure importance of choosing one primary form and a secondary form of contraception and that the patient must be compliant in use as outlined in the Guide for Patients who can get Pregnant. Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for isotretinoin capsules (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin capsules treatment, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after isotretinoin capsules therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: Must be enrolled with the iPLEDGE REMS by the prescriber Must understand that life-threatening birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by patients who can become pregnant Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for patients who can become pregnant Must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Patients Who Can Become Pregnant Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, patients who can become pregnant must meet the following conditions: Must NOT be pregnant or breast-feeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIA-certified laboratory Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is the patient who can become pregnant responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ) or telephone (1-866-495-0654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy, and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patient's two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should the patient become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must enroll the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed Pharmacy Enrollment Form. After enrolling, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions on the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide, specifically the \"Key Information for Pharmacists\" section including the following dispensing information: Prescriptions must be obtained no later than the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date, and if not obtained, then the RMA must be reversed in the iPLEDGE REMS system and the product returned to inventory. I understand and will comply with Non-Compliance Action Policy. I will only obtain isotretinoin capsules product from only iPLEDGE enrolled wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if the pharmacy is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. I will comply with the audits by the iPLEDGE Sponsors or third party acting on behalf of the iPLEDGE Sponsors to ensure that all processes and procedures are in place and being followed for the iPLEDGE REMS To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ), or telephone (1-866-495-0654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive isotretinoin capsules. write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed: in no more than a 30-day supply with an isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS prior to the \"do not dispense to patient after\" date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for patients who can become pregnant) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS (No automatic refills are allowed) An isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time isotretinoin capsules is dispensed, as required by law. This isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Isotretinoin capsules must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE REMS. Only FDA-approved isotretinoin capsules products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and used. Patients must obtain isotretinoin capsules prescriptions only at US licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE REMS educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE REMS requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. Prescriber Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified isotretinoin capsules prescription. Pharmacist Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. The iPLEDGE REMS is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the risks and benefits of isotretinoin capsules which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. The Fact Sheet for the iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the iPLEDGE REMS, the product indications and safety information. This handout is provided to both the patient who can become pregnant and the patient who cannot become pregnant. The Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant is also provided to all patients. Patients who can become pregnant are provided with a Guide for Patients who Can Get Pregnant , which contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects, and a toll-free line which provides isotretinoin capsules information in two languages. The booklet for patients who can become pregnant, Contraception Counseling Guide , includes a referral program that offers patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects. The Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant outlines the effectiveness of the approved contraception options. (see Information for Patients ). General Although an effect of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin capsules or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin capsules while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin capsules has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules are dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules, while taking isotretinoin capsules and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete, and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin capsules or soon after stopping isotretinoin capsules, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin capsules have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin capsules becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin capsules. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin capsules. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin capsules to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin capsules therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John's Wort: Isotretinoin capsules use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin : Isotretinoin capsules have not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test: Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin capsules. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose: Some patients receiving isotretinoin have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6\u00d7 background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy Category X See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive isotretinoin capsules. Pediatric Use The use of isotretinoin capsules in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of isotretinoin capsules for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Use of isotretinoin capsules in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u226518 years). Results from this study demonstrated that isotretinoin, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with isotretinoin, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density >5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Although an effect of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin capsules or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin capsules while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin capsules has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules are dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules, while taking isotretinoin capsules and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete, and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin capsules or soon after stopping isotretinoin capsules, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin capsules have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin capsules becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin capsules. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin capsules. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin capsules to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin capsules therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John's Wort: Isotretinoin capsules use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin : Isotretinoin capsules have not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together."

The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose: Some patients receiving isotretinoin have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mg/kg in rats and mice (>600 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the rat dose for total body surface area and >300 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the mouse dose for total body surface area) and is approximately 1960 mg/kg in rabbits (653 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Isotretinoin capsules cause life-threatening birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). Patients who can become pregnant who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Non-pregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). The recommended dosage range for isotretinoin capsules are 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day 8 , it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects \u2013 some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take isotretinoin capsules with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules have not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of isotretinoin capsules, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density , Hyperostosis , and Premature Epiphyseal closure ). Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Isotretinoin (eye \" soe tret ' i noyn) Capsules, USP Read the Medication Guide that comes with isotretinoin capsules before you start taking it and each time you get a prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about isotretinoin capsules? Isotretinoin capsules are used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. Because isotretinoin capsules can cause birth defects, isotretinoin capsules are only for patients who can understand and agree to carry out all of the instructions in the iPLEDGE REMS.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) : Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 iPLEDGE REMS Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin capsules must be certified by being enrolled and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin capsules, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin capsules to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date Wholesalers and distributors must be enrolled with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin) . Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes have been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin capsules treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines : avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin capsules are closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin capsules at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception are not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: a. Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy b. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy c. Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy d. Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0\u2013t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients 12 years of age and older has been established and is based on a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial (Study 1) in subjects with severe recalcitrant nodular acne who received isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product under fed conditions. A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules are not substitutable with ABSORICA LD \u00ae because of different bioavailability and recommended dosage. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Recommended dosage for isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses without regard to meals for 15 to 20 weeks ( 2.1 ) Adult patients with very severe disease (scarring, trunk involvement) may increase dosage to 2 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules in divided doses. ( 2.1 ) Once daily dosing is not recommended. ( 2.1 ) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. ( 2.1 ) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Isotretinoin capsules are not substitutable with ABSORICA LD \u00ae [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . The recommended dosage of isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, may discontinue isotretinoin capsules. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, may initiate a second course of isotretinoin capsules in patients who have completed skeletal growth. The use of another course of isotretinoin capsules therapy is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient\u2019s acne may continue to improve after a 15 to 20-week course of therapy. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of isotretinoin capsules, even in low dosages, has not been studied, and is not recommended.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri): Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 5.2 iPLEDGE Program Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin must be certified by being registered and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \u201cDo Not Dispense To After\u201d date Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.3 Isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD \u00ae are Not Substitutable Given that the bioavailability and the recommended dosage of isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD \u00ae are different, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD \u00ae are not substitutable. For example, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD \u00ae have a 20 mg strength; however, these strengths have different bioavailability and are not substitutable. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin ). Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin immediately [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes has been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines : avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin is closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE Program requirements [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception is not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: a. Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy b. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy c. Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy d. Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years. Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin capsules to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0-t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)).

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined, and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area)."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients 12 years of age and older has been established and is based on a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial (Study 1) in subjects with severe recalcitrant nodular acne who received isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product under fed conditions. A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

Read each item below and initial in the space provided to show that you understand each item and agree to follow your doctor's instructions. Do not sign this consent and do not take isotretinoin if there is anything that you do not understand. *A parent or guardian of a minor patient (under age 18) must also read and initial each item before signing the consent. ______________________________________________________________________________ (Patient's Name) 1 I understand that there is a very high chance that my unborn baby could have life-threatening birth defects if I am pregnant or become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. This can happen with any amount and even if taken for short periods of time. This is why I must not be pregnant while taking isotretinoin. Initial: __________ 2 I understand that I must not get pregnant one month before, during the entire time of my treatment, and for one month after the end of my treatment with isotretinoin. Initial: __________ 3 I understand that I must avoid having any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant completely, or I must use two separate, effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time . The only exceptions are if I have had surgery to remove the uterus (a hysterectomy) or both of my ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), or my doctor has medically confirmed that I am post-menopausal. Initial: __________ 4 I understand that hormonal birth control products are among the most effective forms of birth control. Combination birth control pills and other hormonal products include skin patches, shots, under-the-skin implants, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Any method of birth control can fail. That is why I must use two different birth control forms at the same time, starting one month before, during, and for one month after stopping therapy every time I have any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant, even if one of the forms I choose is hormonal birth control. Initial: __________ 5 I understand that the following are effective forms of birth control: Primary forms tying my tubes (tubal sterilization) male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination birth control pills, skin patches, shots, under-the skin implants, or vaginal ring. Secondary forms Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) A diaphragm and cervical cap must each be used with spermicide, a special cream that kills sperm. I understand that at least one of my two forms of birth control must be a primary form. Initial: __________ 6 I will talk with my doctor about any medicines including herbal products I plan to take during my isotretinoin treatment because hormonal birth control forms may not work if I am taking certain medicines or herbal products. Initial: __________ 7 I may receive a free birth control counseling session from a doctor or other family planning expert. My isotretinoin doctor can give me an Isotretinoin Contraception Referral Form for this free consultation. Initial: __________ 8 I must begin using the birth control forms I have chosen as described above at least 1one month before I start taking isotretinoin. Initial: __________ 9 I cannot get my first prescription for isotretinoin unless my doctor has told me that I have two negative pregnancy test results. The first pregnancy test should be done when my doctor decides to prescribe isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test must be done in a lab during the first 5 days of my menstrual period right before starting isotretinoin therapy treatment or as instructed by my doctor. I will then have one pregnancy test; in a lab. every month during treatment at the end of treatment and 1 month after stopping treatment I must not start taking isotretinoin until I am sure that I am not pregnant, have negative results from two pregnancy tests, and the second test has been done in a lab.

I have received information on emergency birth control. Initial: __________ 11 I must stop taking isotretinoin right away and call my doctor if I get pregnant, miss my expected menstrual period, stop using birth control, or have any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant without using my two birth control forms at any time. Initial: __________ 12 My doctor provided me information about the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should I become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose. I understand that if I become pregnant, information about my pregnancy, my health, and my baby's health may be shared with the maker of isotretinoin, authorized parties who maintain the iPLEDGE REMS for the makers of isotretinoin and government health regulatory authorities. Initial: __________ 13 I understand that being qualified to receive isotretinoin in the iPLEDGE REMS means that I: have had two negative urine or blood pregnancy tests before receiving the first isotretinoin prescription. The second test must be done in a lab. I must have a negative result from a urine or blood pregnancy test done in a lab repeated each month before I receive another isotretinoin prescription. have chosen and agreed to use two forms of effective birth control at the same time. At least one form must be a primary form of birth control, unless I have chosen never to have any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant (abstinence), or I have undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or I have been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. I must use two forms of birth control for at least one month before I start isotretinoin therapy, during therapy, and for one month after stopping therapy. I must receive counseling, repeated on a monthly basis, about birth control and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy. have signed a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant that contains warnings about the chance of possible birth defects if I am pregnant or become pregnant and my unborn baby is exposed to isotretinoin. have been informed of and understand the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should I become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within 1 month of the last dose. have interacted with the iPLEDGE REMS before starting isotretinoin and on a monthly basis to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter my two chosen forms of birth control.

Initials: __________ 4 I understand that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin ( see #7 below ). Initials: __________ 5 Before I start taking isotretinoin, I agree to tell my doctor if I have ever had symptoms of depression ( see #7 below ), been psychotic, attempted suicide, had any other mental problems, or take medicine for any of these problems. Being psychotic means having a loss of contact with reality, such as hearing voices or seeing things that are not there. Initials: __________ 6 Before I start taking isotretinoin, I agree to tell my doctor if, to the best of my knowledge, anyone in my family has ever had symptoms of depression, been psychotic, attempted suicide, or had any other serious mental problems. Initials: __________ 7 Once I start taking isotretinoin, I agree to stop using isotretinoin and tell my doctor right away if any of the following signs and symptoms of depression or psychosis happen.

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Isotretinoin capsules must not be used by patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin capsules in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects which have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include: skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include: CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Special Prescribing Requirements Because of isotretinoin's teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, isotretinoin capsules are approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This REMS is called iPLEDGE\u2122. Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. 1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of isotretinoin capsules under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high fat meal when compared with isotretinoin capsules given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, isotretinoin capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N = 74 * Eating a standardized high fat meal Isotretinoin Capsules 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC o-\u221e (ng \u2022 hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t \u00bd (hr) Fed * 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u226518 years), the exposure of patients to 4- oxo -isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-lives (t \u00bd ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients (\u2265 18 years) who received isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed. The dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Isotretinoin capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. \"Severe,\" by definition, 2 means \"many\" as opposed to \"few or several\" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, isotretinoin capsules should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, isotretinoin capsules are indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because isotretinoin capsules can cause life-threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin capsules. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure )."

      "WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin capsules may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (\"Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults\"), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological ). Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dL have been reported in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25% of patients receiving isotretinoin capsules in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15% developed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL, and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing isotretinoin capsules. 5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before isotretinoin capsules is given and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to risk/benefit for patients who may be at high risk during isotretinoin capsules therapy (patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin capsules therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin capsules are unknown. Animal Studies In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin capsules; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to isotretinoin capsules therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin capsules have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin capsules treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal ). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range \u20131.6% to \u20137.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the isotretinoin capsules population. While causality to isotretinoin capsules has not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization. 6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin capsules treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All isotretinoin capsules patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin capsules therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night."

      "PRECAUTIONS Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Enrolled and activated pharmacies must receive isotretinoin only from wholesalers enrolled with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE REMS requirements for wholesalers, prescribers, and pharmacists are described below: Wholesalers For the purpose of the iPLEDGE REMS, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor, and/or chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute isotretinoin capsules, wholesalers must be enrolled with iPLEDGE and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must enroll with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include: Enrolling prior to distributing isotretinoin and re-enrolling annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to wholesalers enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS with prior written consent from the manufacturer or pharmacies licensed in the U.S. and enrolled and activated in the iPLEDGE REMS Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any non-enrolled and/or non-activated pharmacy or unenrolled wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE REMS by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if the wholesaler is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the wholesaler chooses to not re-enroll annually Prescribers To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide. I understand and will comply with the Non-Compliance Action Policy. Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any patient who can become pregnant until verifying the patient has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the patient who can become pregnant is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) to: Register each patient in the iPLEDGE REMS. Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education. For patients who can become pregnant : Enter patient's two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the enrolled patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS. Meeting the requirements for a patient who can become pregnant signifies that the patient: Has been counseled and has signed a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time one month before, during, or one month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming isotretinoin therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether the patient has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception: Primary Forms tubal sterilization male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables, or vaginal ring) Secondary Forms Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products; these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking isotretinoin capsules. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single form of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive warnings about the importance of choosing one primary method and a secondary method of contraception and that the patient must be compliant in use as outlined in the Guide for Patients who can get Pregnant. Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for isotretinoin capsules (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: Must be enrolled with the iPLEDGE REMS by the prescriber Must understand that life-threatening birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by patients who can become pregnant Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for patients who can become pregnant Must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Patients Who Can Become Pregnant Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, patients who can become pregnant must meet the following conditions: Must NOT be pregnant or breast-feeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIA-certified laboratory Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is the patient who can become pregnant's responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can become Pregnant, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patient's two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should the patient become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must enroll the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed Pharmacy Enrollment Form. After enrolling, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists, who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions, on the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide, specifically the \"Key Information for Pharmacists\" section including the following dispensing information: Prescriptions must be obtained no later than the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date, and if not obtained, then the RMA must be reversed in the iPLEDGE REMS system and the product returned to inventory. I understand and will comply with the Non-Compliance Action Policy. I will only obtain isotretinoin capsules product from only iPLEDGE enrolled wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if the pharmacy is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. I will comply with the audits by the iPLEDGE Sponsors or third party acting on behalf of the iPLEDGE Sponsors to ensure that all processes and procedures are in place and being followed for the iPLEDGE REMS. To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com), or telephone (1-866-495-0654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive isotretinoin. write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed: in no more than a 30 day supply with a isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS prior to the \"do not dispense to patient after\" date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for patients who can become pregnant) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS (No automatic refills are allowed) An isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time isotretinoin capsules is dispensed, as required by law. This isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Isotretinoin capsules must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE REMS. Only FDA-approved isotretinoin products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and used. Patients must obtain isotretinoin prescriptions only at US licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE REMS educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE REMS requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. Prescriber Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified isotretinoin prescription. Pharmacist Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. The iPLEDGE REMS is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the risks and benefits of isotretinoin which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. The Fact Sheet for the iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the iPLEDGE REMS, the product indications and safety information. This handout is provided to both the patient who can become pregnant and the patient who cannot become pregnant. The Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant is also provided to all patients. Patients who can become pregnant are provided with a Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant , which contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects. The booklet for patients who can become pregnant, Contraception Counseling Guide , includes a referral program that offers patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist; and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects. The Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant outlines the effectiveness of the approved contraception options ( see Information for Patients ). General Although an effect of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin capsules or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin capsules while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin capsules has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules while taking isotretinoin capsules, and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written ( see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in postmarketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin capsules to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin capsules therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John's Wort: Isotretinoin capsules use is associated with depression in some patients ( see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin: Isotretinoin capsules have not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin capsules. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin capsules therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin capsules therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin capsules therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin capsules has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose Some patients receiving isotretinoin capsules have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin capsules therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin capsules therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose-response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin capsules therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive isotretinoin capsules. Pediatric Use The use of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Use of isotretinoin in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u226518 years). Results from this study demonstrated that isotretinoin, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with isotretinoin, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Surveillance The adverse reactions listed below reflect the experience from investigational studies of isotretinoin capsules, and the postmarketing experience. The relationship of some of these events to isotretinoin capsules therapy is unknown. Many of the side effects and adverse reactions seen in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules are similar to those described in patients taking very high doses of vitamin A (dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, e.g., of the lips, nasal passage, and eyes).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mg/kg in rats and mice (> 600 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the rat dose for total body surface area and > 300 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the mouse dose for total body surface area) and is approximately 1960 mg/kg in rabbits (653 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Isotretinoin capsules cause life-threatening birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). Patients who can become pregnant who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Non-pregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). The recommended dosage range for isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day, 8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects \u2013 some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take isotretinoin capsules with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of isotretinoin capsules, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density: Hyperostosis and Premature Epiphyseal Closure ). Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Isotretinoin (eye'' soe tret' i noyn) Capsules, USP Read the Medication Guide that comes with isotretinoin capsules before you start taking it and each time you get a prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about isotretinoin capsules? Isotretinoin capsules are used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. Because isotretinoin capsules can cause birth defects, isotretinoin capsules are only for patients who can understand and agree to carry out all of the instructions in the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsules may cause serious mental health problems. 1 Birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby, and early (premature) births. Patients who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant must not take isotretinoin capsules. Patients must not get pregnant: for 1 month before starting isotretinoin capsules while taking isotretinoin capsules for 1 month after stopping isotretinoin capsules. If you become pregnant while taking isotretinoin capsules, stop taking it right away and call your doctor. Doctors and patients should report all cases of pregnancy to: FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-1088, and the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654 2 Serious mental health problems. Isotretinoin capsules may cause: depression psychosis (seeing or hearing things that are not real) suicide.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri): Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis: If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment: Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities: Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 5.2 iPLEDGE Program Isotretinoin are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30 day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin must be certified by being registered and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30 day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \"Do Not Dispense To Patient After\" date Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.3 Isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are Not Substitutable Given that the bioavailability and the recommended dosage of isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are different, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are not substitutable. For example, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD have a 20 mg strength; however, these strengths have different bioavailability and are not substitutable. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin). Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions and isotretinoin should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15% and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin immediately [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20 week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 months to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 months to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 years to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 weeks to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20 week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 weeks to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes has been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265 350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 years to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A: may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines: avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin is closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception is not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Barrier: Male vasectomy male latex condom with or without spermicide Intrauterine device diaphragm with spermicide Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections or implants) cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: a. Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy b. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy c. Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy d. Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 years to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 years to 17 years. Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 years to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 years to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 years to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20 week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 years to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip or \u2265 5% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 months to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 months to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )]. In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD > 4% and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD > 5% and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range \u22121.6% to \u22127.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 years to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20 week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy."

Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )], inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0-t and C max of isotretinoin were 6,095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4 and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin) and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 years to 15 years (n=38) and \u2265 18 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )].

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 mg/kg/day or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 times or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2 mg/kg/day, 8 mg/kg/day or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3 times, 1.3 times or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/kg/day (10 times or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 mg/kg/day or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 times or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 months to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day to 120 mg/kg/day (30 times to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area)."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 mg/kg/day or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 times or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2 mg/kg/day, 8 mg/kg/day or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3 times, 1.3 times or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/kg/day (10 times or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients 12 years of age and older has been established and is based on a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial (Study 1) in subjects with severe recalcitrant nodular acne who received isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product under fed conditions. A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 years to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 years to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 kg to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 weeks to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage for: Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses without regard to meals for 15 to 20 weeks ( 2.1 ) Adult patients with very severe disease (scarring, trunk involvement) may increase dosage to 2 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules in divided doses. ( 2.1 ) Once daily dosing is not recommended. ( 2.1 ) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. (2.1 ) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of: Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, may discontinue isotretinoin capsules. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, may initiate a second course of isotretinoin capsules in patients who have completed skeletal growth. The use of another course of isotretinoin capsules therapy is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient\u2019s acne may continue to improve after a 15 to 20-week course of therapy. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri): Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.2 iPLEDGE Program Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: o Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment o Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling o Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements o Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] o Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month o Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin must be certified by being registered and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin, and comply with the following requirements: o Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. o Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. o Return isotretinoin to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \u201cDo Not Dispense To After\u201d date Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin). Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes has been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines: avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin is closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception is not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: a. Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy b. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy c. Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy d. Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range \u22121.6% to \u22127.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range \u22121.6% to \u22127.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] ."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In humans, isotretinoin overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. Patients who can become pregnant who present with an isotretinoin overdosage should be evaluated for pregnancy. Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ], inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0-t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were: 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro. The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined, and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, after normalization for total body surface area)."

A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity There is an extremely high risk of life-threatening birth defects when isotretinoin is used in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Instruct patients who can become pregnant that they must not be pregnant during or up to one month after isotretinoin therapy. Instruct patients to not donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation to avoid blood donation to a pregnant patient. iPLEDGE Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program called iPLEDGE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Inform patients who can become pregnant of the following notable requirements. These patients must: Sign an informed consent form to be enrolled in the program Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Inform patients who cannot become pregnant of the following notable requirements. These patients must sign an informed consent form to enroll in the program and they must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit. Isotretinoin is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program.

( 2.1 ) Once daily dosing is not recommended. ( 2.1 ) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. ( 2.1 ) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1 ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) : Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 iPLEDGE REMS Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin capsules must be certified by being enrolled and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin capsules, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin capsules to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date Wholesalers and distributors must be enrolled with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin) . Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes have been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin capsules treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines : avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin capsules are closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin capsules at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception are not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0\u2013t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area).

A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules are not substitutable with ABSORICA LD because of different bioavailability and recommended dosage. (2.1 , 5.3) Recommended dosage for: Isotretinoin capsules are 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses without regard to meals for 15 to 20 weeks (2.1) Adult patients with very severe disease (scarring, trunk involvement) may increase dosage to 2 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules in divided doses. (2.1) Once daily dosing is not recommended. (2.1) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. (2.1) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. (2.3 , 8.3) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Isotretinoin capsules are not substitutable with ABSORICA LD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . The recommended dosage of: Isotretinoin capsules are 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules are missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, may discontinue isotretinoin capsules. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, may initiate a second course of isotretinoin capsules in patients who have completed skeletal growth. The use of another course of isotretinoin capsules therapy is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient\u2019s acne may continue to improve after a 15 to 20-week course of therapy. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri): Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines (5.5) Serious Skin Reactions: Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions (5.6) Acute Pancreatitis: If occurs, discontinue treatment (5.7) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled (5.8) Hearing Impairment: Discontinue and refer to specialized care (5.9) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy (5.10 , 5.15) Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea (5.11) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities: Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure (5.12) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam (5.13) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 iPLEDGE Program Isotretinoin are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin must be certified by being registered and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \u201cDo Not Dispense To After\u201d date Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.3 Isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are Not Substitutable Given that the bioavailability and the recommended dosage of isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are different, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD are not substitutable. For example, isotretinoin and ABSORICA LD have a 20 mg strength; however, these strengths have different bioavailability and are not substitutable. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin) . Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin capsules and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes has been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A: may cause additive adverse reactions (7.1) Tetracyclines: avoid concomitant use (7.2) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin is closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) . 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Risk Summary Isotretinoin are contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception is not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years. Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin capsules to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range \u22121.6% to \u22127.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Risk Summary Isotretinoin are contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years. Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin capsules to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects.

These symptoms quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. Patients who can become pregnant who present with an isotretinoin overdosage should be evaluated for pregnancy. Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0-t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were: 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area).

A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin capsules and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage for: Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses without regard to meals for 15 to 20 weeks (2.1) Adult patients with very severe disease (scarring, trunk involvement) may increase dosage to 2 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules in divided doses. (2.1) Once daily dosing is not recommended. (2.1) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. (2.1) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. (2.3 , 8.3) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of: Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, may discontinue isotretinoin capsules. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, may initiate a second course of isotretinoin capsules in patients who have completed skeletal growth. The use of another course of isotretinoin capsules therapy is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient\u2019s acne may continue to improve after a 15 to 20-week course of therapy. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of isotretinoin capsules, even in low dosages, has not been studied, and is not recommended. The effect of long-term use of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 2.3 Laboratory Testing Prior to Administration The following laboratory testing must be completed prior to isotretinoin capsules use: Pregnancy testing: Ensure patient is not pregnant prior to administering isotretinoin capsules [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] A fasting lipid profile including triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.15) ] .

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) : Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines (5.5) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions (5.6) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment (5.7) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled (5.8) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care (5.9) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy (5.10 , 5.15) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea (5.11) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure (5.12) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam (5.13) 5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin capsules are contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin capsules even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin capsules treatment, discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin capsules therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.2 iPLEDGE Program Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin capsules must be certified by being registered and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin capsules, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin capsules to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \u201c Do Not Dispense To After \u201d date Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin capsules may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin ). Prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin capsules use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin capsules treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin capsules in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin capsules therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin capsules should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin capsules and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes has been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin capsules treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Allergic Reactions Due to the Inactive Ingredient (FD&C Yellow No. 5) in the 25 mg Isotretinoin Capsule The 25 mg isotretinoin capsule contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of tartrazine sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. The 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, and 40 mg isotretinoin capsules do not contain FD&C Yellow No. 5. Thus, in patients with allergic reactions to tartrazine, avoid using the 25 mg isotretinoin capsules. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription , repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin capsules therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin capsules is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A: may cause additive adverse reactions (7.1) Tetracyclines: avoid concomitant use (7.2) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin capsules are closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin capsules at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) . 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin capsules therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Risk Summary Isotretinoin capsules are contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin capsules are used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin capsules, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin capsules therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin capsules therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin capsules therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin capsules therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules therapy, during isotretinoin capsules therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin capsules therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception is not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin capsules therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Barrier: Male vasectomy male latex condom with or without spermicide Intrauterine device diaphragm with spermicide Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin capsules immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin capsules therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin capsules for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years. Use of isotretinoin capsules in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin capsules to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin capsules in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range \u22121.6% to \u22127.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin capsules did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin capsules therapy."

The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin capsules did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with isotretinoin capsules therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In humans, isotretinoin overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. Patients who can become pregnant who present with an isotretinoin capsules overdosage should be evaluated for pregnancy. Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin capsules overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin capsules are a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin capsules in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin capsules are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Capsules Administration The isotretinoin capsules mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin capsules pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0-t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin capsules dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin capsules may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were: 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin capsules 40 mg dose. Metabolism : Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro. The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion : Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4-oxo-isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin capsules dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin capsules dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined, and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin capsules dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin capsules dosage of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of isotretinoin capsules for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients 12 years of age and older has been established and is based on a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial (Study 1) in subjects with severe recalcitrant nodular acne who received isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product under fed conditions. A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin capsules or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin capsules and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

This can happen with any amount and even if taken for short periods of time. This is why I must not be pregnant while taking isotretinoin. Initial: __________ I understand that I must not get pregnant one month before, during the entire time of my treatment, and for one month after the end of my treatment with isotretinoin. Initial: __________ I understand that I must avoid having any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant completely, or I must use two separate, effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time . The only exceptions are if I have had surgery to remove the uterus (a hysterectomy) or both of my ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), or my doctor has medically confirmed that I am post-menopausal. Initial: __________ I understand that hormonal birth control products are among the most effective forms of birth control. Combination birth control pills and other hormonal products include skin patches, shots, under-the-skin implants, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Any method of birth control can fail. That is why I must use two different birth control forms at the same time, starting one month before, during, and for one month after stopping therapy every time I have any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant, even if one of the forms I choose is hormonal birth control. Initial: __________ I understand that the following are effective forms of birth control: Primary forms tying my tubes (tubal sterilization) male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination birth control pills, skin patches, shots, under-the skin implants, or vaginal ring) Secondary forms Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) A diaphragm and cervical cap must each be used with spermicide, a special cream that kills sperm.

My isotretinoin doctor can give me an Isotretinoin Contraception Referral Form for this free consultation. Initial: __________ 8. I must begin using the birth control forms I have chosen as described above at least one month before I start taking isotretinoin. Initial: __________ 9. I cannot get my first prescription for isotretinoin unless my doctor has told me that I have two negative pregnancy test results. The first pregnancy test should be done when my doctor decides to prescribe isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test must be done in a lab during the first 5 days of my menstrual period right before starting isotretinoin therapy treatment, or as instructed by my doctor. I will then have one pregnancy test; in a lab. every month during treatment at the end of treatment and 1 month after stopping treatment I must not start taking isotretinoin until I am sure that I am not pregnant, have negative results from two pregnancy tests, and the second test has been done in a lab.

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Isotretinoin must not be used by patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects which have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include: skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include: CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Special Prescribing Requirements Because of isotretinoin's teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, isotretinoin is approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This REMS is called iPLEDGE \u00ae . Isotretinoinmust only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoinmust only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. 1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of isotretinoin under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with isotretinoin given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, isotretinoin capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N = 74 Isotretinoin 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC 0-\u221e (ng \u2022 hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t \u00bd (hr) Fed * 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) * Eating a standardized high-fat meal Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u226518 years), the exposure of patients to 4- oxo -isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-lives (t \u00bd ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients (\u2265 18 years) who received isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed. The dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients. Table 3.

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of isotretinoin under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with isotretinoin given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, isotretinoin capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N = 74 Isotretinoin 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC 0-\u221e (ng \u2022 hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t \u00bd (hr) Fed * 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) * Eating a standardized high-fat meal Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Isotretinoin capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. \u201cSevere,\u201d by definition, 2 means \u201cmany\u201d as opposed to \u201cfew or several\u201d nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, isotretinoin capsules should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics . In addition, isotretinoin capsulesare indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because isotretinoin capsules can cause life-threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin capsules. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS, Skeletal, Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, Premature Epiphyseal Closure )."

      "WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Psychiatric ). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin . Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (\u201cRecognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults\u201d), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Neurological ). Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dL have been reported in patients treated with isotretinoin. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25% of patients receiving isotretinoin in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15% developed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL, and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of isotretinoin therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing isotretinoin. 5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before isotretinoin is given and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to risk/benefit for patients who may be at high risk during isotretinoin therapy (patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Animal Studies: In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinointreatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Special Senses ). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to isotretinoin therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with isotretinoin, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Gastrointestinal ). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range \u20131.6% to \u20137.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures, and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the isotretinoin population. While causality to isotretinoin has not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that isotretinoin be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization. 6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All isotretinoin patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Special Senses ). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Special Senses ). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night."

      "PRECAUTIONS Isotretinoin must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Enrolled and activated pharmacies must receive isotretinoin only from wholesalers enrolled with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE REMS requirements for wholesalers, prescribers, and pharmacists are described below: Wholesalers: For the purpose of the iPLEDGE REMS, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor, and/or chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute isotretinoin, wholesalers must be enrolled with iPLEDGE, and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must enroll with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include: Enrolling prior to distributing isotretinoin and re-enrolling annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to -wholesalers enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS with prior written consent from the manufacturer or -pharmacies licensed in the U.S. and enrolled and activated in the iPLEDGE REMS Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any non-enrolled and/or non-activated pharmacy or unenrolled wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection/audit of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE REMS by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if the wholesaler is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the wholesaler chooses to not re-enroll annually Prescribers: To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling, or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide . Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin, and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any patient who can become pregnant until verifying the patient has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the patient who can become pregnant is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) to: 1) Register each patient in the iPLEDGE REMS. 2) Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education. 3) For patients who can become pregnant: Enter patient\u2019s two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the enrolled patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS. Meeting the requirements for a patient who can become pregnant signifies that the patient: Has been counseled and has signed a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. - For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. - For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time one month before, during, or one month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming isotretinoin therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether the patient has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception: Primary forms tubal sterilization male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables, or vaginal ring) Secondary forms Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products; these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single form of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive warnings about the importance of choosing one primary method and a secondary method of contraception and that the patient must be compliant in use as outlined in the Guide for Patients who can get Pregnant. Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for isotretinoin (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: Must be enrolled with the iPLEDGE REMS by the prescriber Must understand that life-threatening birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by patients who can become pregnant Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for patients who can become pregnant Must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Patients Who Can Become Pregnant Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, patients who can become pregnant must meet the following conditions: Must NOT be pregnant or breast-feeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIA-certified laboratory Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is the patient who can become pregnant responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy, and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patient\u2019s two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should the patient become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists: To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must enroll the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed Pharmacy Enrollment Form. After enrolling, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions on the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide, specifically the \u201cKey Information for Pharmacists\u201d section including the following dispensing information: Prescriptions must be obtained no later than the \u201cDo Not Dispense To After\u201d date, and if not obtained, then the RMA must be reversed in the iPLEDGE REMS system and the product returned to inventory. I understand and will comply with the Non-Compliance Action Policy. I will only obtain isotretinoin capsules product from only iPLEDGE enrolled wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if the pharmacy is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. I will comply with the audits by the iPLEDGE Sponsors or third party acting on behalf of the iPLEDGE Sponsors to ensure that all processes and procedures are in place and being followed for the iPLEDGE REMS. To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com), or telephone (1-866-495-0654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive isotretinoin. write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed: in no more than a 30-day supply with an Isotretinoin Capsules Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS prior to the \u201cdo not dispense to patient after\u201d date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for patients who can become pregnant) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS (No automatic refills are allowed) An isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time isotretinoin capsules is dispensed, as required by law. This isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Isotretinoin capsules must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE REMS. Only FDA-approved isotretinoin products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and used. Patients must obtain isotretinoin prescriptions only at US licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE REMS educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE REMS requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. Prescriber Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified isotretinoin prescription. Pharmacist Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. The iPLEDGE REMS is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the risks and benefits of isotretinoin which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. The Fact Sheet for the iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the iPLEDGE REMS, the product indications and safety information. This handout is provided to both the patient who can become pregnant and the patient who cannot become pregnant. The Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant is also provided to all patients. Patients who can become pregnant are provided with a Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant , which contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects, and a toll-free line which provides isotretinoin information in two languages. The booklet for patients who can become pregnant, Contraception Counseling Guide , includes a referral program that offers patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects. The Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant outlines the effectiveness of the approved contraception options (see Information for Patients ). General Although an effect of isotretinoin on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules are dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules, while taking isotretinoin capsules, and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete, and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \u201canxious\u201d or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests, CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving Ortho-Novum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John\u2019s Wort: Isotretinoin use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS, Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. Phenytoin: Isotretinoin has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test - Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. - For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. - For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. - Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS, Lipids ). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin has been established (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose Some patients receiving isotretinoin have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy Category X See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive isotretinoin. Pediatric Use The use of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Use of isotretinoin in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u226518 years). Results from this study demonstrated that isotretinoin, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with isotretinoin, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS, Skeletal, Bone Mineral Density ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Although an effect of isotretinoin on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules are dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules, while taking isotretinoin capsules, and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete, and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \u201canxious\u201d or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests, CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving Ortho-Novum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John\u2019s Wort: Isotretinoin use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS, Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. Phenytoin: Isotretinoin has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test - Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. - For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. - For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. - Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS, Lipids ). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin has been established (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose Some patients receiving isotretinoin have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial."

In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Isotretinoin causes life-threatening birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). Patients who can become pregnant who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Non-pregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients ). The recommended dosage range for isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day, 8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects \u2013 some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take isotretinoin capsules with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth.

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Isotretinoin capsules must not be used by patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin capsules in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects which have been documented following isotretinoin capsules exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include: skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include: CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Special Prescribing Requirements Because of isotretinoin teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, isotretinoin capsules approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This REMS is called iPLEDGE \u00ae . Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsule s must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. 1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 \u00d7 40 mg capsules) of isotretinoin under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with isotretinoin given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, isotretinoin should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N=74 Isotretinoin 2\u00d740 mg Capsules AUC 0\u2013\u221e (ng\u2219hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t 1/2 (hr) Fed Eating a standardized high-fat meal. 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u226518 years), the exposure of patients to 4-oxo-isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1SD elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients (\u226518 years) who received isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4- oxo- isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed. The dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients. Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Following Single and Multiple Dose Administration in Pediatric Patients, 12 to 15 Years of Age Mean (\u00b1 SD), N=38 The single and multiple dose data in this table were obtained following a non-standardized meal that is not comparable to the high-fat meal that was used in the study in Table 2 .

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Isotretinoin capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. \"Severe,\" by definition, 2 means \"many\" as opposed to \"few or several\" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, isotretinoin capsules should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, isotretinoin capsules are indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because isotretinoin capsules can cause life-threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin capsules. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, Premature Epiphyseal Closure )."

      "WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin capsules may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (\"Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults\"), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological ). Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dL have been reported in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25% of patients receiving isotretinoin capsules in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15% developed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL, and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing isotretinoin capsules. 5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before isotretinoin capsules are given and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin capsules is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to risk/benefit for patients who may be at high risk during isotretinoin capsules therapy (patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin capsules therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin capsules are unknown. Animal Studies In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin capsules; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to isotretinoin capsules therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin capsules have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin capsules treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal ). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density >5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13\u201318 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures, and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the isotretinoin capsules population. While causality to isotretinoin capsules have not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization. 6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x\u2013ray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin capsules treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin capsules on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All isotretinoin capsules patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue isotretinoin capsules treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin capsules therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night."

      "PRECAUTIONS Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed by prescribers who are enrolled and activated with the iPLEDGE REMS. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are enrolled and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Enrolled and activated pharmacies must receive isotretinoin capsules only from wholesalers enrolled with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE REMS requirements for wholesalers, prescribers, and pharmacists are described below: Wholesalers: For the purpose of the iPLEDGE REMS, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor, and/or chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute isotretinoin capsules, wholesalers must be enrolled with iPLEDGE, and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must enroll with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include: Enrolling prior to distributing isotretinoin and re-enrolling annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to \u2013 wholesalers enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS with prior written consent from the manufacturer or \u2013 pharmacies licensed in the US and enrolled and activated in the iPLEDGE REMS Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any non-enrolled and/or non-activated pharmacy or unenrolled wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE REMS by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if the wholesaler is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the wholesaler chooses to not re-enroll annually Prescribers To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling, or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide. Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin, and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any patient who can become pregnant until verifying the patient has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the patient who can become pregnant is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) to: 1) Register each patient in the iPLEDGE REMS. 2) Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education . 3) For patients who can become pregnant: Enter patient's two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the enrolled patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS. Meeting the requirements for a patient who can become pregnant signifies that the patient: Has been counseled and has signed a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. \u2013 For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. \u2013 For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time one month before, during, or one month after therapy, the patient must: 1. Stop taking isotretinoin capsules immediately, if on therapy 2. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy 3. Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming isotretinoin capsules therapy 4. Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether the patient has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception: Primary forms Secondary forms tubal sterilization male vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables, or vaginal ring) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products; these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking isotretinoin capsules. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single form of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive warnings about the rates of possible contraception failure importance of choosing one primary form and a secondary form of contraception and that the patient must be compliant in use as outlined in the Guide for Patients who can get Pregnant. Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for isotretinoin capsules (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin capsules treatment, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after isotretinoin capsules therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: Must be enrolled with the iPLEDGE REMS by the prescriber Must understand that life-threatening birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by patients who can become pregnant Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for patients who can become pregnant Must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Patients Who Can Become Pregnant Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, patients who can become pregnant must meet the following conditions: Must NOT be pregnant or breast-feeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIA-certified laboratory Must obtain the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is the patient who can become pregnant responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ) or telephone (1-866-495-0654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy, and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patient's two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should the patient become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must enroll the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed Pharmacy Enrollment Form. After enrolling, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions on the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide, specifically the \"Key Information for Pharmacists\" section including the following dispensing information: \u2013 Prescriptions must be obtained no later than the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date, and if not obtained, then the RMA must be reversed in the iPLEDGE REMS system and the product returned to inventory. I understand and will comply with Non-Compliance Action Policy. I will only obtain isotretinoin capsules product from only iPLEDGE enrolled wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if the pharmacy is deactivated by the iPLEDGE REMS or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. I will comply with the audits by the iPLEDGE Sponsors or third party acting on behalf of the iPLEDGE Sponsors to ensure that all processes and procedures are in place and being followed for the iPLEDGE REMS To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: 1) be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. 2) obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com), or telephone (1-866-495-0654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive isotretinoin capsules. 3) write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Isotretinoin capsules must only be dispensed: in no more than a 30-day supply with an isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS prior to the \"do not dispense to patient after\" date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for patients who cannot become pregnant and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for patients who can become pregnant) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE REMS (No automatic refills are allowed) An isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time isotretinoin capsules is dispensed, as required by law. This isotretinoin capsules Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Isotretinoin capsules must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE REMS. Only FDA-approved isotretinoin capsules products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and used. Patients must obtain isotretinoin capsules prescriptions only at US licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE REMS educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE REMS requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. 1) Prescriber Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified isotretinoin capsules prescription. 2) Pharmacist Guide includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. 3) The iPLEDGE REMS is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the risks and benefits of isotretinoin capsules which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. 4) The Fact Sheet for the iPLEDGE REMS includes information on the iPLEDGE REMS, the product indications and safety information. This handout is provided to both the patient who can become pregnant and the patient who cannot become pregnant. The Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant is also provided to all patients. 5) Patients who can become pregnant are provided with a Guide for Patients who Can Get Pregnant , which contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects, and a toll-free line which provides isotretinoin capsules information in two languages. 6) The booklet for patients who can become pregnant, Contraception Counseling Guide , includes a referral program that offers patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist and a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant concerning birth defects. 7) The Guide for Patients Who Can Get Pregnant outlines the effectiveness of the approved contraception options. (see Information for Patients ). General Although an effect of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin capsules or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin capsules while involved in these activities. While causality to isotretinoin capsules has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when isotretinoin capsules are dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE REMS patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who cannot get Pregnant. Patients who can become pregnant must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when isotretinoin capsules therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting isotretinoin capsules, while taking isotretinoin capsules and for one month after isotretinoin capsules have been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy. They should also sign a second Patient Enrollment Form for Patients who can get Pregnant prior to beginning isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients who can become pregnant should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another isotretinoin capsules prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking isotretinoin capsules, but the amount delivered to a patient who can become pregnant would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete, and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of isotretinoin capsules treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether isotretinoin capsules therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin capsules therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin capsules or soon after stopping isotretinoin capsules, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin capsules have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin capsules becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin capsules. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin capsules. Patients must be informed that they must not share isotretinoin capsules with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin capsules. Patients should be reminded to take isotretinoin capsules with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during isotretinoin capsules therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of isotretinoin capsules to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin capsules use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin capsules therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John's Wort: Isotretinoin capsules use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin : Isotretinoin capsules have not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin capsules. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test: \u2013 Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin capsules. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. \u2013 For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. \u2013 For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. \u2013 Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription. Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to isotretinoin has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose: Some patients receiving isotretinoin have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose-related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6\u00d7 background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy Category X See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive isotretinoin capsules. Pediatric Use The use of isotretinoin capsules in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of isotretinoin capsules for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Use of isotretinoin capsules in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u226518 years). Results from this study demonstrated that isotretinoin, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with isotretinoin, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density >4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density >5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Surveillance The adverse reactions listed below reflect the experience from investigational studies of isotretinoin , and the postmarketing experience. The relationship of some of these events to isotretinoin therapy is unknown. Many of the side effects and adverse reactions seen in patients receiving isotretinoin are similar to those described in patients taking very high doses of vitamin A (dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, e.g. of the lips, nasal passage, and eyes).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mg/kg in rats and mice (>600 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the rat dose for total body surface area and >300 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the mouse dose for total body surface area) and is approximately 1960 mg/kg in rabbits (653 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Isotretinoin capsules cause life-threatening birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). Patients who can become pregnant who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Non-pregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Isotretinoin capsules should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). The recommended dosage range for isotretinoin capsules are 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day 8 , it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects \u2013 some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take isotretinoin capsules with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules have not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of isotretinoin capsules, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of isotretinoin capsules on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal closure ).

( 2.1 ) Once daily dosing is not recommended. ( 2.1 ) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. ( 2.1 ) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1 ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, may discontinue isotretinoin capsules. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, may initiate a second course of isotretinoin capsules in patients who have completed skeletal growth. The use of another course of isotretinoin therapy is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient's acne may continue to improve after a 15 to 20-week course of therapy.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) : Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 iPLEDGE REMS Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin capsules must be certified by being enrolled and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin capsules, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin capsules to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date Wholesalers and distributors must be enrolled with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin) . Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes have been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin capsules treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines : avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin capsules are closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin capsules at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception are not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: a. Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy b. Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy c. Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy d. Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use of isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] ."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In humans, isotretinoin overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. Patients who can become pregnant who present with an isotretinoin overdosage should be evaluated for pregnancy. Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0\u2013t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro . Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro . The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined, and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area)."

A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity There is an extremely high risk of life-threatening birth defects when isotretinoin is used in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Instruct patients who can become pregnant that they must not be pregnant during or up to one month after isotretinoin therapy. Instruct patients to not donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation to avoid blood donation to a pregnant patient. iPLEDGE Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program called iPLEDGE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Inform patients who can become pregnant of the following notable requirements. These patients must: Sign an informed consent form to be enrolled in the program Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Inform patients who cannot become pregnant of the following notable requirements. These patients must sign an informed consent form to enroll in the program and they must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit. Isotretinoin is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Therefore, provide patients with the telephone number and website for information on how to obtain isotretinoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lactation Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] . Psychiatric Disorders Instruct patients and/or their caregivers/families that isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and aggressive or violent behavior. Instruct patients to read the Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults brochure prior to taking isotretinoin capsules. Instruct patients to stop isotretinoin capsules and to contact a healthcare provider if they develop any of these signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Important Administration Instructions To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Advise patients that intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) has occurred with isotretinoin use including concomitant use with tetracyclines.

( 2.1 ) Once daily dosing is not recommended. ( 2.1 ) If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses of isotretinoin capsules at the same time. ( 2.1 ) Perform pregnancy tests prior to prescribing, each month during therapy, end of therapy, and one month after discontinuation. ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) Prior to prescribing, perform fasting lipid profile and liver function tests. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Isotretinoin capsules is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with or without meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1 ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, instruct patients to swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. During treatment, the dosage may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or adverse reactions, some of which may be dose-related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dosage adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day for isotretinoin capsules in divided doses, as tolerated. The safety and effectiveness of once daily dosing with isotretinoin capsules has not been established and is not recommended. If a dose of isotretinoin capsules is missed, just skip that dose.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Psychiatric Disorders (depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors): Prior to and during therapy assess for these conditions; stop if these conditions occur on therapy ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) : Avoid use with concomitant tetracyclines ( 5.5 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Monitor for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and other serious skin reactions ( 5.6 ) Acute Pancreatitis : If occurs, discontinue treatment ( 5.7 ) Lipid Abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and elevation of cholesterol): Monitor lipid levels at regular intervals; stop if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled ( 5.8 ) Hearing Impairment : Discontinue and refer to specialized care ( 5.9 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Discontinue for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea ( 5.11 ) Musculoskeletal Abnormalities : Arthralgias, back pain, decreases in bone mineral density and premature epiphyseal closure ( 5.12 ) Ocular Abnormalities e.g., corneal opacities, decreased night vision: If visual symptoms occur, discontinue and refer for an ophthalmological exam ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Based on human data, isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an extremely high risk that life-threatening birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births have been documented following exposure to isotretinoin during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088, and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet ( www.ipledgeprogram.com ). Patients must be informed not to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation because the blood might be given to a pregnant patient whose fetus must not be exposed to isotretinoin. Isotretinoin capsules is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 5.2 iPLEDGE REMS Isotretinoin capsules are available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the iPLEDGE REMS because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Notable requirements of the iPLEDGE REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program and comply with the following requirements: Determine reproductive status of all patients prior to initiating treatment Provide contraception counseling to patients who can get pregnant prior to and during treatment, or refer patients who can get pregnant to an expert for such counseling Provide scheduled pregnancy testing, and verify and document the negative pregnancy test result prior to writing each prescription, for no more than a 30-day supply Patients who can become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must comply with the following requirements Comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Demonstrate comprehension of the safe-use conditions of the program every month Obtain the prescription within 7 days of the pregnancy test collection Patients who cannot become pregnant must be enrolled by signing an informed consent form and must obtain the prescription within 30 days of the office visit Pharmacies that dispense isotretinoin capsules must be certified by being enrolled and activated in the program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive isotretinoin capsules, and comply with the following requirements: Only dispense a maximum of a 30-day supply with a Medication Guide. Do not dispense refills. Dispense only with a new prescription and a new authorization from the program. Return isotretinoin capsules to inventory if patients do not obtain the prescription by the \"Do Not Dispense To After\" date Wholesalers and distributors must be enrolled with the program and must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies and distributors, is available at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654. 5.4 Psychiatric Disorders Isotretinoin may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Healthcare providers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to help ensure patients receive the help they need (Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin) . Prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is necessary. Patients should immediately stop isotretinoin capsules and the patient (or caregiver) should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression. Discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary such as a referral to a mental healthcare professional. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) Isotretinoin use has been associated with cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided with isotretinoin use. Early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These reactions may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued if they occur. 5.7 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. If symptoms of pancreatitis occur, discontinue isotretinoin capsules and seek medical attention. 5.8 Lipid Abnormalities Elevations of serum triglycerides above 800 mg/dL have been reported with isotretinoin use. In clinical trials, marked elevations of serum triglycerides, decreases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and increases in cholesterol levels were reported in 25%, 15%, and 7% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, respectively. These lipid changes were reversible upon isotretinoin capsule cessation. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight and restriction of dietary fat and alcohol while continuing isotretinoin or through dosage reduction. The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with isotretinoin are unknown. Fasting lipid tests should be performed before isotretinoin treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Careful consideration should be given to risk/benefit of isotretinoin in patients who are at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If isotretinoin therapy is instituted in such patients, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids are recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Isotretinoin should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled. 5.9 Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking isotretinoin; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this reaction have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue isotretinoin treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis has been reported with isotretinoin use. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials with isotretinoin capsules, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment, isotretinoin capsules should be discontinued. 5.11 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Isotretinoin has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after isotretinoin treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue isotretinoin capsules immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.12 Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Bone Mineral Density Changes, Osteoporosis, and Fractures Isotretinoin may have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. In a clinical trial of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product, 27/306 (9%) of adolescents had BMD declines, defined as \u2265 4% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u2265 5% femoral neck, during the 20-week treatment period. Repeat scans conducted within 2 to 3 months after the post-treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term data at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 patients had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. Therefore, healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing isotretinoin capsules to patients with a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . There have been spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, fractures and/or delayed healing of fractures in patients while on therapy with isotretinoin or following cessation of therapy with isotretinoin. Patients in early and late adolescence who participate in sports with repetitive impact may be at an increased risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures, and hip growth plate injuries have been reported. Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of isotretinoin. In a trial of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 8% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects of multiple courses of isotretinoin on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high-dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. It is important that isotretinoin capsules be given at the recommended dose for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules (approximately 1.1 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of 8 patients in a prospective trial of disorders of keratinization. Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective trials of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple isotretinoin treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin capsules given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous literature reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of isotretinoin capsules. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents on isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 (3%) patients had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which a drug-related effect cannot be excluded. 5.13 Ocular Abnormalities Visual problems should be carefully monitored. If visual difficulties occur, discontinue isotretinoin treatment and obtain an ophthalmological examination [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving isotretinoin capsules and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with isotretinoin capsules have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of isotretinoin [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during isotretinoin use and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Dry Eyes Dry eyes have been reported in patients during isotretinoin use. Patients who wear contact lenses may have trouble wearing them while on isotretinoin capsules treatment and afterwards. 5.14 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported with isotretinoin use. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. 5.15 Laboratory Abnormalities and Laboratory Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Laboratory Monitoring Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to obtaining a prescription, repeated each month, at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Lipid Tests Pretreatment and follow-up fasting lipid tests should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before testing is performed. It is recommended that these tests be performed periodically until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 25% in patients treated with isotretinoin capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Liver Function Tests As elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported in patients on isotretinoin capsules, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed periodically until the response to isotretinoin is known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Additional Laboratory Abnormalities Glucose With isotretinoin use, some patients have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during isotretinoin use. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while taking isotretinoin have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis with isotretinoin use, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 924 patients, marked elevations in CPK (\u2265350 U/L) were observed in approximately 24% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules. In another clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this clinical trial."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Vitamin A : may cause additive adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Tetracyclines : avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Vitamin A Isotretinoin capsules are closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin capsules at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin capsules should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 7.2 Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin capsules and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. 7.5 Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol In a trial of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin capsules within the recommended dosage, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Although this study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). Risk Summary Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin capsules, isotretinoin capsules must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Data Human Data Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential All patients who can become pregnant must comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pregnancy Testing Isotretinoin capsules must only be prescribed to patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin capsules prescription (the interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days). The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to prescribe isotretinoin therapy. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) is performed after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month and during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with regular menstrual cycles) or immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy (for patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding). A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient receiving each prescription. A pregnancy test must also be completed at the end of the entire course of isotretinoin therapy and 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules. Contraception Patients who can become pregnant must use 2 forms of contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, for at least 1 month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for 1 month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. However, 2 forms of contraception are not required if the patient commits to continuous abstinence from not having any sexual contact with a partner which may result in pregnancy, has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\"minipills\" that do not contain an estrogen) are an inadequate method of contraception during isotretinoin therapy. Primary forms Secondary forms Tubal sterilization Male vasectomy Intrauterine device Hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, injections, or implants) Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: Vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from patients who have used combination oral contraceptives, as well as contraceptive vaginal systems, vaginal inserts, transdermal systems, and injections; these pregnancies occurred while taking isotretinoin. These reports are more frequent for patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that patients who can become pregnant use 2 methods of contraception simultaneously. A clinical drug interaction study did not show any clinically significant interaction between isotretinoin and norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; however, it is not known if there is an interaction between isotretinoin with other progestins [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Prescribers are advised to consult the prescribing information of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients who can become pregnant should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because of a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. If the patient has unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy at any time 1 month before, during, or 1 month after therapy, the patient must: Stop taking isotretinoin immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy Start using 2 forms of contraception simultaneously again for 1 month before resuming isotretinoin therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Infertility In a trial of female acne patients (n = 79) receiving another isotretinoin capsule product, the mean total ovarian volume, the total antral follicle count and mean anti-Mullerian hormone decreased at the end of the treatment (sixth month). However, the values returned to normal at the 18 th month (12 months after the end of treatment). There were no statistically significant changes in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both at the end of the treatment and 12 months after the end of treatment. Although the results suggest that possible deteriorative effects of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve may be reversible, the study has important methodological limitations, including a small sample size, lack of a control group, and lack of generalizability. Sperm Study In trials of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne have been established in pediatric subjects ages 12 to 17 years . Use of isotretinoin in this age group for this indication is supported by evidence from a clinical trial (Study 1) that compared the use isotretinoin to another isotretinoin capsule product in 397 pediatric subjects (12 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of isotretinoin in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects In trials with isotretinoin capsules, adverse reactions reported in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric subjects. In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

In a trial of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old treated with isotretinoin capsules, approximately 29% (104/358) developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 14% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female subjects than male subjects. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric subjects including severe arthralgias in 8% (6/79) of subjects. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in adolescents who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin. Consider discontinuing isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found. Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric Subjects The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) of a 20-week course of therapy with isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 396 adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne (mean age 15.4 years old, range 12 to 17 years old, 80% males). Given that there were no statistically significant differences between the two isotretinoin capsule groups following 20 weeks of treatment, the results are presented for the pooled treatment groups. The mean changes in BMD from baseline for the overall trial population were 1.8% for lumbar spine, -0.1% for total hip and -0.3% for femoral neck. Mean BMD Z-scores declined from baseline at each of these sites (-0.053, -0.109 and -0.104 respectively). Out of 306 adolescents, 27 (9%) had clinically significant BMD declines defined as \u22654% lumbar spine or total hip, or \u22655% femoral neck, including 2 subjects for lumbar spine, 17 for total hip and 20 for femoral neck. Repeat DXA scans within 2 to 3 months after the post treatment scan showed no recovery of BMD. Long-term follow-up at 4 to 11 months showed that 3 out of 7 subjects had total hip and femoral neck BMD below pre-treatment baseline, and 2 others did not show the increase in BMD above baseline expected in this adolescent population. The significance of these changes in regard to long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . In an open-label clinical trial (N=217) of a single course of therapy with isotretinoin capsules for adolescents with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, BMD at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change >-4% and total hip change >-5%) or were increased in the majority of subjects. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine BMD >4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (8%) subjects had decreases in lumbar spine BMD >4%, and all the other subjects (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine subjects (5%) had a decrease in total hip BMD >5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty-one (11%) subjects had decreases in total hip BMD >5%, and all the other subjects (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up trials performed in 8 of the subjects with decreased BMD for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing BMD in 5 subjects at the lumbar spine, while the other 3 subjects had lumbar spine BMD measurements below baseline values. Total hip BMD remained below baseline (range -1.6% to -7.6%) in 5 of 8 subjects (63%). In a separate open-label extension trial of 10 subjects including those ages 13 to 17 years, who started a second course of isotretinoin capsules 4 months after the first course, two subjects showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine BMD up to 3.3%. Epiphyseal Closure There are reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients who used isotretinoin at recommended doses. The effect of multiple courses of isotretinoin on epiphyseal closure is unknown. In a 20-week clinical trial that included 289 adolescents who had hand radiographs taken to assess bone age, a total of 9 subjects had bone age changes that were clinically significant and for which an isotretinoin-related effect cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric subjects (subjects aged 65 years of age and older) to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adults, effects of aging may increase some risks associated with an isotretinoin therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In humans, isotretinoin overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. Patients who can become pregnant who present with an isotretinoin overdosage should be evaluated for pregnancy. Because an overdosage would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients treated with isotretinoin should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a patient who is or might become pregnant, for 1 month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least 1 month."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] , inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with isotretinoin capsules and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects without acne were reported in published literature. Absorption Following Isotretinoin Administration The isotretinoin mean T max was 6.4 hours under fed conditions and 2.9 hours under fasting conditions following administration of a single 40 mg dose. Effect on Food No clinically significant differences in isotretinoin pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a modified high-fat, high-calorie meal (123.2 calories from protein, 265.6 calories from carbohydrates, and 468 calories from fat; total calories 857 calories) with reduced vitamin A content. The mean AUC 0\u2013t and C max of isotretinoin were 6095 ng*hr/mL and 369 ng/mL, respectively, following administration of a single 40 mg isotretinoin dose under fed conditions; which were approximately 50% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. However, isotretinoin may be given with or without meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Elimination The mean elimination half-lives of isotretinoin and its 4-oxo-isotretinoin metabolite were: 18 hours and 38 hours, respectively, after a single oral isotretinoin 40 mg dose. Metabolism: Isotretinoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2B6 in vitro. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates. Following oral administration of isotretinoin capsules, at least three metabolites (4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin)) have been identified in human plasma. The extent of formation of all metabolites was higher under fed conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity in vitro. The clinical significance is unknown. Excretion: Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of radiolabeled-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, the metabolites of isotretinoin were excreted in feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were observed based on age (12 to 15 years (n=38), and \u226518 years (n=19)). In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] .

The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to humans is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative, while in the second laboratory, a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 times background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose response effect was seen, and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8, or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3, or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis, but some sperm were observed in all testes examined, and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical isotretinoin dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of isotretinoin for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients 12 years of age and older has been established and is based on a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial (Study 1) in subjects with severe recalcitrant nodular acne who received isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product under fed conditions. A total of 925 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive isotretinoin or another isotretinoin capsule product. Study subjects ranged from 12 to 54 years of age (including 397 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old); 60% were male, 40% were female; and the racial groups included 87% White, 4% Black, 6% Asian, and 3% Other. Enrolled subjects had a weight of 40 to 110 kg and had at least 10 nodular lesions on the face and/or trunk. Subjects were treated with an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for the following 16 weeks. Change from baseline to Week 20 in total nodular lesion count and proportion of subjects with at least a 90% reduction in total nodular lesion count from baseline to Week 20 are presented in Table 3. Total nodular lesion counts by visit are presented in Figure 1. A single course of isotretinoin and another isotretinoin capsule product therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of acne in many patients.
