    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits sensitized mast cell degranulation which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of mediators from mast cells. Studies show that cromolyn sodium indirectly blocks calcium ions from entering the mast cell, thereby preventing mediator release. Cromolyn sodium inhibits both the immediate and non-immediate bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled antigen. Cromolyn sodium also attenuates bronchospasm caused by exercise, toluene diisocyanate, aspirin, cold air, sulfur dioxide, and environmental pollutants. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic bronchodilator or antihistamine activity. After administration by inhalation, approximately 8% of the total cromolyn sodium dose administered is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged, approximately equally divided between urine and bile. The remainder of the dose is either exhaled or deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed and excreted via the alimentary tract."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Indications and Usage Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is a prophylactic agent indicated in the management of patients with bronchial asthma. In patients whose symptoms are sufficiently frequent to require a continuous program of medication, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is given by inhalation on a regular daily basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The effect of cromolyn sodium is usually evident after several weeks of treatment, although some patients show an almost immediate response. In patients who develop acute bronchoconstriction in response to exposure to exercise, toluene diisocyanate, environmental pollutants, etc., cromolyn sodium should be given shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General Occasionally, patients may experience cough and/or bronchospasm following inhalation of cromolyn sodium. At times, patients who develop bronchospasm may not be able to continue cromolyn sodium administration despite prior bronchodilator administration. Rarely, very severe bronchospasm has been encountered. Symptoms of asthma may recur if cromolyn sodium is reduced below the recommended dosage or discontinued. Information for Patients Cromolyn sodium is to be taken as directed by the physician. Because it is preventive medication, it may take up to four weeks before the patient experiences maximum benefit. Cromolyn sodium should be used in a power-driven nebulizer with an adequate airflow rate equipped with a suitable face mask or mouthpiece. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled Living a Full Life with Asthma. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous treatment at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. These doses correspond to approximately 1.0, 0.3, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 18 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg and 164 mg/kg, respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg produced no evidence of fetal malformations. These doses represent approximately 27, 17, and 98 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice. Cromolyn sodium alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations. Isoproterenol alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) increased both resorptions and malformations. The addition of cromolyn sodium (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) to isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when cromolyn sodium is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

      "Living a Full Life with Asthma Patient Instructions Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution, USP You or your child may be among the millions of Americans who have asthma. For most patients, asthma need not limit your lifestyle, if you closely follow the asthma management plan your doctor provides you. Your doctor has given you this instruction sheet to help you learn more about asthma and ways to control it. WHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a disease that causes patients to have difficulty breathing. Asthma \u201cattacks\u201d occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from passing through. The closing up is caused by two things: The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This swelling is caused by a certain type of inflammation that can build up in the airways of patients with asthma. Inflammation and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur. figure 02 WHAT CAUSES THESE ATTACKS? Asthma experts know that patients with asthma have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or \u201ctriggers\u201d, such as cold dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with asthma may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often. Asthma triggers fall into 6 categories: Substances that cause allergies (pollens, animal dander, molds, house dust, some foods and medicines) Infections that affect breathing (colds, flu) Emotional stress (difficult situations at home, school, or work) Strenuous exercise Irritating gases (chlorine, perfume, tobacco smoke) Sudden changes in temperature or humidity figure 03 HOW TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS No medicine or procedure will \u201ccure\u201d asthma. The key to asthma relief, therefore, is to prevent attacks and to relieve attack symptoms if they do occur. A successful prevention plan* will do the following: Keep your activities, including exercise, at normal levels. Keep your lungs functioning normally or at a near-normal level. Prevent symptoms such as coughing or breathlessness that can keep you up at night, or occur in the early morning hours, or after exertion. Prevent asthma attacks from happening. Avoid unpleasant or harmful side effects that may result from using asthma medicine. The best way to prevent asthma attacks is to avoid the triggers that bother you or your child. Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks. If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin-like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do. * Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. National Asthma Education Program, Expert Panel Report, 1991 figure 04 OTHER DO\u2019S AND DON\u2019TS Anyone with asthma should stick to a healthy, balanced diet, get lots of rest and moderate exercise, and follow these do\u2019s and don\u2019ts: Don\u2019t smoke, and don\u2019t stay in the same room with people that do. Avoid fresh paint. Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Don\u2019t go in and out of extremely cool air-conditioned buildings during hot weather. Stay home in extremely cold weather, if possible. Stay away from people with cold or flu. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting situations. Drink lots of liquids. Don\u2019t overdo, but follow a regular exercise plan, including activities that help develop lung capacity. Don\u2019t take any medicine on your own without asking your doctor first. Take all medicines your doctor prescribes, as much and as often as you are told. Avoid taking sleeping pills or sedatives, even if asthma keeps you awake. Prop yourself up with extra pillows until your asthma medicine takes effect. Avoid breathing in insecticides, deodorants, cleaning fluids, chlorine, or other irritating gases. figure 05 ASTHMA MEDICINES Preventive Medicine Your doctor knows that, besides relieving an attack when it happens, it is also important to prevent attacks from occurring in the first place. Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents asthma attacks by making airways less sensitive to asthma triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an asthma attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause inflammation and asthma attacks. By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent asthma attacks. Bronchodilators When someone is having an asthma attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve asthma attacks. Your doctor may have already prescribed this medicine for you to use at that time. figure 06 HOW WILL CROMOLYN SODIUM WORK FOR YOU? To get the best possible results, follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully when you first take cromolyn sodium. Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium, regularly, as often as your doctor recommends, even though you have no asthma symptoms at the time. Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of inflammation in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your asthma under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor. When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you wheeze or cough, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you prevent asthma attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress. While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks. While taking cromolyn sodium, you should continue taking your other medications until your doctor advises you otherwise. HOW TO TAKE CROMOLYN SODIUM Be sure to follow instructions carefully when you are shown how to take cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. CARE AND STORAGE Cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution should be stored at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Retain in foil pouch until time of use. PROTECT FROM LIGHT. Do not use if it contains a precipitate (particles or cloudiness) or becomes discolored. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration For management of bronchial asthma in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Patients with chronic asthma should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately. For the prevention of acute bronchospasm which follows exercise or exposure to cold dry air, environmental agents (e.g., animal danders, toluene diisocyanate, pollutants), etc., the usual dose is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor. It should be emphasized to the patient that the drug is poorly absorbed when swallowed and is not effective by this route of administration. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled \u201cLiving a Full Life with Asthma\u201d . Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma: Non-steroidal agents: Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually. If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates. Corticosteroids: In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma. It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma. It is particularly important that great care be exercised if, for any reason, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is withdrawn in cases where its use has permitted a reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. In such cases, continued close supervision of the patient is essential since there may be sudden reappearance of severe manifestations of asthma which will require immediate therapy and possible reintroduction of corticosteroids."

      "Instructions for the Use of Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution, USP An aqueous solution for nebulization NOT FOR INJECTION For best results, follow these instructions exactly and observe Care and Storage directions. METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is recommended for use in a power driven nebulizer operated at an airflow rate of 6-8 liters per minute and equipped with a suitable face mask. Hand-operated nebulizers are not suitable for the administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. Your doctor will advise on the choice of a suitable nebulizer and how it should be used. Do not use any appliance without consulting your doctor. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. DOSAGE Nebulization should be carried out four times a day at regular intervals, or as directed by your doctor. Use the contents of a fresh vial each time. INHALATION Once the nebulizer has been assembled and contains cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, hold the mask close to the patient\u2019s face and switch on the device. The patient should breathe in through the mouth and out through the nose in a normal, relaxed manner. Nebulization should take approximately five to ten minutes. 1. Remove a single unit-dose vial from strip (Figure 1) Figure 1 2. Open the unit-dose vial by twisting off the tabbed top section (Figure 2). Figure 2 3. Squeeze the contents of the unit-dose vial into the solution container of your nebulizer (Figure 3). Discard the empty unit-dose vial. Figure 3 figure 07 figure 08 figure 09"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and SRS-A (slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis) from the mast cell. Another activity demonstrated in vitro is the capacity of cromolyn sodium to inhibit the degranulation of non-sensitized rat mast cells by phospholipase A and the subsequent release of chemical mediators. Another study showed that cromolyn sodium did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of released phospholipase A on its specific substrate. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistaminic or anti-inflammatory activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed. When multiple doses of cromolyn sodium ophthalmic solution are instilled into normal rabbit eyes, less than 0.07% of the administered dose of cromolyn sodium is absorbed into the systemic circulation (presumably by way of the eye, nasal passages, buccal cavity and gastrointestinal tract). Trace amounts (less than 0.01%) of the cromolyn sodium dose penetrate into the aqueous humor and clearance from this chamber is virtually complete within 24 hours after treatment is stopped. In normal volunteers, analysis of drug excretion indicates that approximately 0.03% of cromolyn sodium is absorbed following administration to the eye."

The average daily maximum dose levels administered in these studies were 192.9 mg/m 2 for mice, 47.2 mg/m 2 for hamsters and 385.8 mg/m 2 for rats. These doses correspond to approximately 6.8, 1.7 and 14 times the maximum daily human dose of 28 mg/m 2 . Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella /microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomycas cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day (1050 mg/m 2 ) in males and 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 ) in females.

These doses represent approximately 57, 35, and 205 times the maximum daily human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

      "DESCRIPTION The active ingredient of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is cromolyn sodium, USP. It is an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent for the preventive management of asthma. Cromolyn sodium, USP is chemically designated as disodium 5,5'- [(2-hydroxytrimethylene)dioxy] bis [4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate]. The molecular formula is C 23 H 14 Na 2 O 11 ; the molecular weight is 512.34. Cromolyn sodium, USP is a water-soluble, odorless, white, hydrated crystalline powder. It is tasteless at first, but leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is clear, colorless, sterile and has a target pH of 5.5. The structural formula is: Each 2 mL vial for oral inhalation use only contains 20 mg cromolyn sodium, USP in water for injection, USP."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits sensitized mast cell degranulation which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of mediators from mast cells. Studies show that cromolyn sodium indirectly blocks calcium ions from entering the mast cell, thereby preventing mediator release. Cromolyn sodium inhibits both the immediate and non-immediate bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled antigen. Cromolyn sodium also attenuates bronchospasm caused by exercise, toluene diisocyanate, aspirin, cold air, sulfur dioxide and environmental pollutants. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic bronchodilator or antihistaminic activity. After administration by inhalation, approximately 8% of the total cromolyn sodium dose administered is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged, approximately equally divided between urine and bile. The remainder of the dose is either exhaled or deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed and excreted via the alimentary tract."

In patients whose symptoms are sufficiently frequent to require a continuous program of medication, Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is given by inhalation on a regular daily basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The effect of cromolyn sodium is usually evident after several weeks of treatment, although some patients show an almost immediate response. In patients who develop acute bronchoconstriction in response to exposure to exercise, toluene diisocyanate, environmental pollutants, etc., cromolyn sodium should be given shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Occasionally, patients may experience cough and/or bronchospasm following inhalation of cromolyn sodium. At times, patients who develop bronchospasm may not be able to continue cromolyn sodium administration despite prior bronchodilator administration. Rarely, very severe bronchospasm has been encountered. Symptoms of asthma may recur if cromolyn sodium is reduced below the recommended dosage or discontinued. Information for Patients Cromolyn sodium is to be taken as directed by the physician. Because it is preventive medication, it may take up to four weeks before the patient experiences maximum benefit. Cromolyn sodium should be used in a power-driven nebulizer with an adequate airflow rate equipped with a suitable face mask or mouthpiece. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled \"Living a Full Life with Asthma'. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous treatment at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. These doses correspond to approximately 1.0, 0.3, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 18 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg and 164 mg/kg, respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg produced no evidence of fetal malformations. These doses represent approximately 27, 17, and 98 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice. Cromolyn sodium alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations. lsoproterenol alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) increased both resorptions and malformations. The addition of cromolyn sodium (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) to isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when cromolyn sodium is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

These effects rarely require treatment or discontinuation of the drug. Information on the incidence of adverse reactions to cromolyn sodium for inhalation capsules has been derived from U.S. postmarketing surveillance experience. The following adverse reactions attributed to cromolyn sodium, based upon recurrence following readministration, have been reported in less than 1 in 10,000 patients: laryngeal edema, swollen parotid gland, angioedema, bronchospasm, joint swelling and pain, dizziness, dysuria and urinary frequency, nausea, cough, wheezing, headache, nasal congestion, rash, urticaria and lacrimation. Other adverse reactions have been reported in less than 1 in 100,000 patients, and it is unclear whether these are attributable to the drug: anaphylaxis, nephrosis, periarteritic vasculitis, pericarditis, peripheral neuritis, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, polymyositis, exfoliative dermatitis, hemoptysis, anemia, myalgia, hoarseness, photodermatitis, and vertigo."

Acute toxicity testing in a wide variety of species has demonstrated that toxicity with cromolyn sodium occurs only with very high exposure levels, regardless of whether administration was parenteral, oral or by inhalation. Parenteral administration in mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits demonstrated a median lethal dose of approximately 4000 mg/kg. Intravenous administration in monkeys also indicated a similar pattern of toxicity. The highest dose administered by the oral route in rats and mice was 8000 mg/kg, (approximately 261 and 130 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) and at this dose level no deaths occurred. By inhalation, even in long term studies, it proved impossible to achieve toxic dose levels of cromolyn sodium in a range of mammalian species."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For management of bronchial asthma in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Patients with chronic asthma should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately. For the prevention of acute bronchospasm which follows exercise or exposure to cold dry air, environmental agents (e.g., animal danders, toluene diisocyanate, pollutants), etc., the usual dose is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor. It should be emphasized to the patient that the drug is poorly absorbed when swallowed and is not effective by this route of administration. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled \"Living a Full Life with Asthma\". Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma Non-steroidal agents Cromolyn sodium should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually. If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates. Corticosteroids In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma. It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma. It is particularly important that great care be exercised if, for any reason, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is withdrawn in cases where its use has permitted a reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. In such cases, continued close supervision of the patient is essential since there may be sudden reappearance of severe manifestations of asthma which will require immediate therapy and possible reintroduction of corticosteroids."

      "LIVING A FULL LIFE WITH ASTHMA PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS CROMOLYN SODIUM inhalation solution, USP You or your child may be among the millions of Americans who have asthma. For most patients, asthma need not limit your lifestyle, if you closely follow the asthma management plan your doctor provides you. Your doctor has given you this instruction sheet to help you learn more about asthma and ways to control it. WHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a disease that causes patients to have difficulty breathing. Asthma \"attacks\" occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from passing through. The closing up is caused by two things: The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This swelling is caused by a certain type of inflammation that can build up in the airways of patients with asthma. Inflammation and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur. WHAT CAUSES THESE ATTACKS? Asthma experts know that patients with asthma have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or \"triggers\", such as cold dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with asthma may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often. Asthma triggers fall into 6 categories: Substances that cause allergies (pollens, animal dander, molds, house dust, some foods and medicines) Infections that affect breathing (colds, flu) Emotional stress (difficult situations at home, school, or work) Strenuous exercise Irritating gases (chlorine, perfume, tobacco smoke) Sudden changes in temperature or humidity HOW TD PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS No medicine or procedure will \"cure\" asthma. The key to asthma relief, therefore, is to prevent attacks and to relieve attack symptoms if they do occur. A successful prevention plan* will do the following: Keep your activities, including exercise, at normal levels. Keep your lungs functioning normally or at a near-normal level. Prevent symptoms such as coughing or breathlessness that can keep you up at night, or occur in the early morning hours, or after exertion. Prevent asthma attacks from happening. Avoid unpleasant or harmful side effects that may result from using asthma medicine. The best way to prevent asthma attacks is to avoid the triggers that bother you or your child. Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks. If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin-like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do. *Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma, National Asthma Education Program, Expert Panel Report,1991. OTHER DO'S AND DON'TS Anyone with asthma should stick to a healthy, balanced diet, get lots of rest and moderate exercise, and follow these do's and dont's: Don't smoke, and don\u2019t stay in the same room with people that do. Avoid fresh paint. Avoid sudden changes of temperature Don't go in and out of extremely cool air-conditioned buildings during hot weather. Stay home in extremely cold weather, if possible. Stay away from people with cold or flu. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting situations. Drink lots of liquids. Don't overdo, but follow a regular exercise plan, including activities that help develop lung capacity. Don't take any medicine on your own without asking your doctor first. Take all medicines your doctor prescribes, as much and as often as you are told. Avoid taking sleeping pills or sedatives, even if asthma keeps you awake. Prop yourself up with extra pillows until your asthma medicine takes effect. Avoid breathing in insecticides, deodorants, cleaning fluids, chlorine, or other irritating gases. ASTHMA MEDICINES Preventive Medicine Your doctor knows that, besides relieving an attack when it happens, it is also important to prevent attacks from occurring in the first place. Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents asthma attacks by making airways less sensitive to asthma triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an asthma attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause inflammation and asthma attacks. By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent asthma attacks. Bronchodilators When someone is having an asthma attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve asthma attacks. Your doctor may have already prescribed this medicine for you to use at that time. HOW WILL CROMOLYN SODIUM WORK FOR YOU? To get the best possible results, follow your doctor's instructions carefully when you first take cromolyn sodium. Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium, regularly, as otten as your doctor recommends, even though you have no asthma symptoms at the time. Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of inflammation in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your asthma under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor. When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you wheeze or cough, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you prevent asthma attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress. While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks. While taking cromolyn sodium, you should continue taking your other medications until your doctor advises you otherwise. HOW TO TAKE CROMOLYN SODIUM Be sure to follow instructions carefully when you are shown how to take cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. CARE AND STORAGE Cromolyn Sodium inhalation solution, USP should be stored at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Retain in foil pouch until time of use. PROTECT FROM LIGHT. Do not use if it contains a precipitate (particles or cloudiness) or becomes discolored. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. NOTE: In case of difficulty consult your doctor or pharmacist Instructions for the Use of Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP An aqueous solution for nebulization NOT FOR INJECTION For best results, follow these instructions exactly and observe Care and Storage directions. METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is recommended for use in a power driven nebulizer operated at an airflow rate of 6-8 liters per minute and equipped with a suitable face mask. Hand operated nebulizers are not suitable for the administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. Your doctor will advise on the choice of a suitable nebulizer and how it should be used. Do not use any appliance without consulting your doctor. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. DOSAGE Nebulization should be carried out four times a day at regular intervals, or as directed by your doctor. Use the contents of a fresh vial each time. INHALATION Once the nebulizer has been assembled and contains cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, hold the mask close to the patient's face and switch on the device. The patient should breathe in through the mouth and out through the nose in a normal, relaxed manner. Nebulization should take approximately five to ten minutes. Remove a single unit-dose vial from strip (Figure 1). Open the unit-dose vial by twisting off the tabbed top section (Figure 2). Squeeze the contents of the unit-dose vial into the solution container of your nebulizer (Figure 3). Discard the empty unit-dose vial.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and SRS-A (slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis) from the mast cell. Another activity demonstrated in vitro is the capacity of cromolyn sodium to inhibit the degranulation of non-sensitized rat mast cells by phospholipase A and the subsequent release of chemical mediators. Another study showed that cromolyn sodium did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of released phospholipase A on its specific substrate. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistaminic or anti-inflammatory activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed. When multiple doses of cromolyn sodium ophthalmic solution are instilled into normal rabbit eyes, less than 0.07% of the administered dose of cromolyn sodium is absorbed into the systemic circulation (presumably by way of the eye, nasal passages, buccal cavity and gastrointestinal tract). Trace amounts (less than 0.01%) of the cromolyn sodium dose penetrate into the aqueous humor and clearance from this chamber is virtually complete within 24 hours after treatment is stopped. In normal volunteers, analysis of drug excretion indicates that approximately 0.03% of cromolyn sodium is absorbed following administration to the eye."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Patients may experience a transient stinging or burning sensation following application of Cromolyn Sodium Ophthalmic Solution USP, 4%. The recommended frequency of administration should not be exceeded (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Information for Patients Patients should be advised to follow the patient instructions listed on the Information for Patients sheet. Users of contact lenses should refrain from wearing lenses while exhibiting the signs and symptoms of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, or vernal keratitis. Do not wear contact lenses during treatment with Cromolyn Sodium Ophthalmic Solution USP, 4%. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 52.6 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous administration at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. The average daily maximum dose levels administered in these studies were 192.9 mg/m 2 for mice, 47.2 mg/m 2 for hamsters and 385.8 mg/m 2 for rats. These doses correspond to approximately 6.8, 1.7 and 14 times the maximum daily human dose of 28 mg/m 2 . Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella /microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomycas cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day (1050 mg/m 2 ) in males and 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 ) in females. These doses are approximately 37 and 21 times the maximum daily human dose, respectively, based on mg/m 2 . Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg (1620 mg/m 2 ) and 164 mg/kg (984 mg/m 2 ), respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg (5820 mg/m 2 ) produced no evidence of fetal malformation. These doses represent approximately 57, 35, and 205 times the maximum daily human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Ophthalmic Solution USP, 4% is administered to a nursing woman.

Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Four randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis; two of which utilized a placebo-controlled crossover design, one utilized an active controlled (chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine) crossover design, and one utilized a placebo-controlled parallel group design. Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function. The benefit seen with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate 200 mg QID was similar to chlorpheniramine (4 mg QID) plus cimetidine (300 mg QID) for both cutaneous and systemic symptoms of mastocytosis. Clinical improvement occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted for 2-3 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate did not affect urinary histamine levels or peripheral eosinophilia, although neither of these variables appeared to correlate with disease severity. Positive clinical benefits were also reported for 37 of 51 patients who received Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate in United States and foreign humanitarian programs."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In carcinogenicity studies in mice, hamsters, and rats, cromolyn sodium had no neoplastic effects at intraperitoneal doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week for 12 months in mice, at intraperitoneal doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks in hamsters, and at subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week for 18 months in rats. These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg. No such interaction was observed in rats or rabbits. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: In adult rats no adverse effects of cromolyn sodium were observed at oral doses up to 6144 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). In neonatal rats, cromolyn sodium increased mortality at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or greater (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis) but not at doses of 300 mg/kg or less (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis). Plasma and kidney concentrations of cromolyn after oral administration to neonatal rats were up to 20 times greater than those in older rats. In term infants up to six months of age, available clinical data suggest that the dose should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. The use of this product in pediatric patients less than two years of age should be reserved for patients with severe disease in which the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution, Concentrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg. No such interaction was observed in rats or rabbits. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: In adult rats no adverse effects of cromolyn sodium were observed at oral doses up to 6144 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). In neonatal rats, cromolyn sodium increased mortality at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or greater (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis) but not at doses of 300 mg/kg or less (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis). Plasma and kidney concentrations of cromolyn after oral administration to neonatal rats were up to 20 times greater than those in older rats. In term infants up to six months of age, available clinical data suggest that the dose should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. The use of this product in pediatric patients less than two years of age should be reserved for patients with severe disease in which the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "DESCRIPTION: Each 5 mL ampule of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) contains 100 mg cromolyn sodium, USP, in purified water. Cromolyn sodium is a hygroscopic, white powder having little odor. It may leave a slightly bitter aftertaste. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is clear, colorless, and sterile. It is intended for oral use. Chemically, cromolyn sodium is disodium 5,5\u2019-[(2-hydroxy-trimethylene) dioxy]bis[4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate]. The empirical formula is C 23 H 14 Na 2 O 11 ; the molecular weight is 512.34. Its chemical structure is: Pharmacologic Category: Mast cell stabilizer Therapeutic Category: Antiallergic"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."

Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function.

In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg.

      "DESCRIPTION: Each 5 mL ampule of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) contains 100 mg cromolyn sodium, USP, in purified water. Cromolyn sodium is a hygroscopic, white powder having little odor. It may leave a slightly bitter aftertaste. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is clear, colorless, and sterile. It is intended for oral use. Chemically, cromolyn sodium is disodium 5,5\u2019-[(2-hydroxy-trimethylene) dioxy]bis[4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate]. The empirical formula is C 23 H 14 Na 2 O 11 ; the molecular weight is 512.34. Its chemical structure is: Pharmacologic Category: Mast cell stabilizer Therapeutic Category: Antiallergic"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."
    ],
    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Four randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis; two of which utilized a placebo-controlled crossover design, one utilized an active-controlled (chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine) crossover design, and one utilized a placebo-controlled parallel group design. Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function. The benefit seen with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 200 mg QID was similar to chlorpheniramine (4 mg QID) plus cimetidine (300 mg QID) for both cutaneous and systemic symptoms of mastocytosis. Clinical improvement occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted for 2-3 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not affect urinary histamine levels or peripheral eosinophilia, although neither of these variables appeared to correlate with disease severity. Positive clinical benefits were also reported for 37 of 51 patients who received Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in United States and foreign humanitarian programs."

      "PRECAUTIONS: In view of the biliary and renal routes of excretion of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate), consideration should be given to decreasing the dosage of the drug in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In carcinogenicity studies in mice, hamsters, and rats, cromolyn sodium had no neoplastic effects at intraperitoneal doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week for 12 months in mice, at intraperitoneal doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks in hamsters, and at subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week for 18 months in rats. These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits sensitized mast cell degranulation which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of mediators from mast cells. Studies show that cromolyn sodium indirectly blocks calcium ions from entering the mast cell, thereby preventing mediator release. Cromolyn sodium inhibits both the immediate and non-immediate bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled antigen. Cromolyn sodium also attenuates bronchospasm caused by exercise, toluene diisocyanate, aspirin, cold air, sulfur dioxide, and environmental pollutants. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic bronchodilator or antihistamine activity. After administration by inhalation, approximately 8% of the total cromolyn sodium dose administered is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged, approximately equally divided between urine and bile. The remainder of the dose is either exhaled or deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed and excreted via the alimentary tract."

In patients whose symptoms are sufficiently frequent to require a continuous program of medication, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution USP is given by inhalation on a regular daily basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The effect of cromolyn sodium is usually evident after several weeks of treatment, although some patients show an almost immediate response. In patients who develop acute bronchoconstriction in response to exposure to exercise, toluene diisocyanate, environmental pollutants, etc., cromolyn sodium should be given shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Occasionally, patients may experience cough and/or bronchospasm following inhalation of cromolyn sodium. At times, patients who develop bronchospasm may not be able to continue cromolyn sodium administration despite prior bronchodilator administration. Rarely, very severe bronchospasm has been encountered. Symptoms of asthma may recur if cromolyn sodium is reduced below the recommended dosage or discontinued. Information for Patients Cromolyn sodium is to be taken as directed by the physician. Because it is preventive medication, it may take up to four weeks before the patient experiences maximum benefit. Cromolyn sodium should be used in a power-driven nebulizer with an adequate airflow rate equipped with a suitable face mask or mouthpiece. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled Living a Full Life with Asthma. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous treatment at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. These doses correspond to approximately 1.0, 0.3, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 18 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg and 164 mg/kg, respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg produced no evidence of fetal malformations. These doses represent approximately 27, 17, and 98 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice. Cromolyn sodium alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations. Isoproterenol alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) increased both resorptions and malformations. The addition of cromolyn sodium (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) to isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when cromolyn sodium is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials; however, a causal relationship could not be established: drowsiness, nasal itching, nose bleed, nose burning, serum sickness, and stomachache.

The most common side effects are associated with inhalation of the powder and include transient cough (1 in 5 patients) and mild wheezing (1 in 25 patients). These effects rarely require treatment or discontinuation of the drug. Information on the incidence of adverse reactions to cromolyn sodium for inhalation capsules has been derived from U.S. postmarketing surveillance experience. The following adverse reactions attributed to cromolyn sodium, based upon recurrence following readministration, have been reported in less than 1 in 10,000 patients: laryngeal edema, swollen parotid gland, angioedema, bronchospasm, joint swelling and pain, dizziness, dysuria and urinary frequency, nausea, cough, wheezing, headache, nasal congestion, rash, urticaria and lacrimation. Other adverse reactions have been reported in less than 1 in 100,000 patients, and it is unclear whether these are attributable to the drug: anaphylaxis, nephrosis, periarteritic vasculitis, pericarditis, peripheral neuritis, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, polymyositis, exfoliative dermatitis, hemoptysis, anemia, myalgia, hoarseness, photodermatitis, and vertigo."

Acute toxicity testing in a wide variety of species has demonstrated that toxicity with cromolyn sodium occurs only with very high exposure levels, regardless of whether administration was parenteral, oral or by inhalation. Parenteral administration in mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits demonstrated a median lethal dose of approximately 4000 mg/kg. Intravenous administration in monkeys also indicated a similar pattern of toxicity. The highest dose administered by the oral route in rats and mice was 8000 mg/kg, (approximately 261 and 130 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) and at this dose level no deaths occurred. By inhalation, even in long term studies, it proved impossible to achieve toxic dose levels of cromolyn sodium in a range of mammalian species."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For management of bronchial asthma in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Patients with chronic asthma should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately. For the prevention of acute bronchospasm which follows exercise or exposure to cold dry air, environmental agents (e.g., animal danders, toluene diisocyanate, pollutants), etc., the usual dose is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor. It should be emphasized to the patient that the drug is poorly absorbed when swallowed and is not effective by this route of administration. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled \u201cLiving a Full Life with Asthma\u201d . Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma Non-steroidal agents Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually. If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates. Corticosteroids In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma. It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma. It is particularly important that great care be exercised if, for any reason, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is withdrawn in cases where its use has permitted a reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. In such cases, continued close supervision of the patient is essential since there may be sudden reappearance of severe manifestations of asthma which will require immediate therapy and possible reintroduction of corticosteroids."

      "LIVING A FULL LIFE WITH ASTHMA PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution, USP You or your child may be among the millions of Americans who have asthma. For most patients, asthma need not limit your lifestyle, if you closely follow the asthma management plan your doctor provides you. Your doctor has given you this instruction sheet to help you learn more about asthma and ways to control it. WHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a disease that causes patients to have difficulty breathing. Asthma \u201cattacks\u201d occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from passing through. The closing up is caused by two things: The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This swelling is caused by a certain type of inflammation that can build up in the airways of patients with asthma. Inflammation and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur. WHAT CAUSES THESE ATTACKS? Asthma experts know that patients with asthma have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or \u201ctriggers\u201d, such as cold dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with asthma may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often. Asthma triggers fall into 6 categories: Substances that cause allergies (pollens, animal dander, molds, house dust, some foods and medicines) Infections that affect breathing (colds, flu) Emotional stress (difficult situations at home, school, or work) Strenuous exercise Irritating gases (chlorine, perfume, tobacco smoke) Sudden changes in temperature or humidity HOW TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS No medicine or procedure will \u201ccure\u201d asthma. The key to asthma relief, therefore, is to prevent attacks and to relieve attack symptoms if they do occur. A successful prevention plan* will do the following: Keep your activities, including exercise, at normal levels. Keep your lungs functioning normally or at a near-normal level. Prevent symptoms such as coughing or breathlessness that can keep you up at night, or occur in the early morning hours, or after exertion. Prevent asthma attacks from happening. Avoid unpleasant or harmful side effects that may result from using asthma medicine. The best way to prevent asthma attacks is to avoid the triggers that bother you or your child. Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks. If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin-like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do. * Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. National Asthma Education Program, Expert Panel Report, 1991. OTHER DO\u2019S AND DON\u2019TS Anyone with asthma should stick to a healthy, balanced diet, get lots of rest and moderate exercise, and follow these do\u2019s and don\u2019ts: Don\u2019t smoke, and don\u2019t stay in the same room with people that do. Avoid fresh paint. Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Don\u2019t go in and out of extremely cool air-conditioned buildings during hot weather. Stay home in extremely cold weather, if possible. Stay away from people with cold or flu. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting situations. Drink lots of liquids. Don\u2019t overdo, but follow a regular exercise plan, including activities that help develop lung capacity. Don\u2019t take any medicine on your own without asking your doctor first. Take all medicines your doctor prescribes, as much and as often as you are told. Avoid taking sleeping pills or sedatives, even if asthma keeps you awake. Prop yourself up with extra pillows until your asthma medicine takes effect. Avoid breathing in insecticides, deodorants, cleaning fluids, chlorine, or other irritating gases. ASTHMA MEDICINES Preventive Medicine Your doctor knows that, besides relieving an attack when it happens, it is also important to prevent attacks from occurring in the first place. Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents asthma attacks by making airways less sensitive to asthma triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an asthma attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause inflammation and asthma attacks. By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent asthma attacks. Bronchodilators When someone is having an asthma attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve asthma attacks. Your doctor may have already prescribed this medicine for you to use at that time. HOW WILL CROMOLYN SODIUM WORK FOR YOU? To get the best possible results, follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully when you first take cromolyn sodium. Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium, regularly , as often as your doctor recommends, even though you have no asthma symptoms at the time. Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of inflammation in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your asthma under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor. When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you wheeze or cough, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you prevent asthma attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress. While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks. While taking cromolyn sodium, you should continue taking your other medications until your doctor advises you otherwise. HOW TO TAKE CROMOLYN SODIUM Be sure to follow instructions carefully when you are shown how to take cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. CARE AND STORAGE Cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution should be stored at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Retain in foil pouch until time of use. PROTECT FROM LIGHT. Do not use if it contains a precipitate (particles or cloudiness) or becomes discolored. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. NOTE: In case of difficulty consult your doctor or pharmacist Manufactured In England By: Norton Healthcare Limited Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 3FA UK Manufactured For: Teva Pharmaceuticals Parsippany, NJ 07054 Rev. B 12/2023 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution, USP An aqueous solution for nebulization NOT FOR INJECTION For best results, follow these instructions exactly and observe Care and Storage directions. METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is recommended for use in a power driven nebulizer operated at an airflow rate of 6 to 8 liters per minute and equipped with a suitable face mask. Hand-operated nebulizers are not suitable for the administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. Your doctor will advise on the choice of a suitable nebulizer and how it should be used. Do not use any appliance without consulting your doctor. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. DOSAGE Nebulization should be carried out four times a day at regular intervals, or as directed by your doctor. Use the contents of a fresh vial each time. INHALATION Once the nebulizer has been assembled and contains cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, hold the mask close to the patient\u2019s face and switch on the device. The patient should breathe in through the mouth and out through the nose in a normal, relaxed manner. Nebulization should take approximately five to ten minutes. 1. Remove a single unit-dose vial from strip (Figure 1). Figure 1 2. Open the unit-dose vial by twisting off the tabbed top section (Figure 2). Figure 2 3. Squeeze the contents of the unit-dose vial into the solution container of your nebulizer (Figure 3). Figure 3 Discard the empty unit-dose vial.

Asthma &#x201C;attacks&#x201D; occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from passing through. The closing up is caused by two things:</td></tr><tr><td> <list listType=\"ordered\" styleCode=\"Arabic\"><item>The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and</item><item>The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This swelling is caused by a certain type of inflammation that can build up in the airways of patients with asthma. Inflammation and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur.</item></list></td><td><renderMultiMedia referencedObject=\"MM2\"/> </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"> <paragraph><content styleCode=\"bold\">WHAT CAUSES THESE ATTACKS?</content></paragraph><paragraph>Asthma experts know that patients with asthma have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or &#x201C;triggers&#x201D;, such as cold dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with asthma may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often.</paragraph> Asthma triggers fall into 6 categories:</td></tr><tr><td> <list listType=\"ordered\" styleCode=\"Arabic\"><item>Substances that cause allergies (pollens, animal dander, molds, house dust, some foods and medicines)</item><item>Infections that affect breathing (colds, flu)</item><item>Emotional stress (difficult situations at home, school, or work)</item><item>Strenuous exercise</item><item>Irritating gases (chlorine, perfume, tobacco smoke)</item><item>Sudden changes in temperature or humidity</item></list></td><td> <renderMultiMedia referencedObject=\"MM3\"/></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"> <content styleCode=\"bold\">HOW TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS</content><paragraph>No medicine or procedure will &#x201C;cure&#x201D; asthma.

Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks.</td><td><renderMultiMedia referencedObject=\"MM4\"/> </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"> If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin-like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do. <paragraph>* Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Four randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis; two of which utilized a placebo-controlled crossover design, one utilized an active-controlled (chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine) crossover design, and one utilized a placebo-controlled parallel group design. Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function. The benefit seen with Cromolyn sodium 200 mg QID was similar to chlorpheniramine (4 mg QID) plus cimetidine (300 mg QID) for both cutaneous and systemic symptoms of mastocytosis. Clinical improvement occurred within 2 to 6 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted for 2 to 3 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL did not affect urinary histamine levels or peripheral eosinophilia, although neither of these variables appeared to correlate with disease severity. Positive clinical benefits were also reported for 37 of 51 patients who received Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL in United States and foreign humanitarian programs."

      "PRECAUTIONS In view of the biliary and renal routes of excretion of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL, consideration should be given to decreasing the dosage of the drug in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility In carcinogenicity studies in mice, hamsters, and rats, cromolyn sodium had no neoplastic effects at intraperitoneal doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week for 12 months in mice, at intraperitoneal doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks in hamsters, and at subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week for 18 months in rats. These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg. No such interaction was observed in rats or rabbits. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use In adult rats no adverse effects of cromolyn sodium were observed at oral doses up to 6144 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). In neonatal rats, cromolyn sodium increased mortality at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or greater (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis) but not at doses of 300 mg/kg or less (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis). Plasma and kidney concentrations of cromolyn after oral administration to neonatal rats were up to 20 times greater than those in older rats. In term infants up to six months of age, available clinical data suggest that the dose should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. The use of this product in pediatric patients less than two years of age should be reserved for patients with severe disease in which the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 100 mg/5 mL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "DESCRIPTION: Each 5 mL ampule of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) contains 100 mg cromolyn sodium, USP, in purified water. Cromolyn sodium is a hygroscopic, white powder having little odor. It may leave a slightly bitter aftertaste. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is clear, colorless, and sterile. It is intended for oral use. Chemically, cromolyn sodium is disodium 5,5\u2019-[(2-hydroxy-trimethylene) dioxy]bis[4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate]. The empirical formula is C 23 H 14 Na 2 O 11 ; the molecular weight is 512.34. Its chemical structure is: Pharmacologic Category: Mast cell stabilizer Therapeutic Category: Antiallergic Cromolyn Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."
    ],
    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Four randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis; two of which utilized a placebo-controlled crossover design, one utilized an active-controlled (chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine) crossover design, and one utilized a placebo-controlled parallel group design. Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function. The benefit seen with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 200 mg QID was similar to chlorpheniramine (4 mg QID) plus cimetidine (300 mg QID) for both cutaneous and systemic symptoms of mastocytosis. Clinical improvement occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted for 2-3 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not affect urinary histamine levels or peripheral eosinophilia, although neither of these variables appeared to correlate with disease severity. Positive clinical benefits were also reported for 37 of 51 patients who received Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in United States and foreign humanitarian programs."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is indicated in the management of patients with mastocytosis. Use of this product has been associated with improvement in diarrhea, flushing, headaches, vomiting, urticaria, abdominal pain, nausea, and itching in some patients."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is contraindicated in those patients who have shown hypersensitivity to cromolyn sodium."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: The recommended dosage should be decreased in patients with decreased renal or hepatic function. Severe anaphylactic reactions may occur rarely in association with cromolyn sodium administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: In view of the biliary and renal routes of excretion of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate), consideration should be given to decreasing the dosage of the drug in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In carcinogenicity studies in mice, hamsters, and rats, cromolyn sodium had no neoplastic effects at intraperitoneal doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week for 12 months in mice, at intraperitoneal doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks in hamsters, and at subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week for 18 months in rats. These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg. No such interaction was observed in rats or rabbits. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: In adult rats no adverse effects of cromolyn sodium were observed at oral doses up to 6144 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). In neonatal rats, cromolyn sodium increased mortality at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or greater (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis) but not at doses of 300 mg/kg or less (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis). Plasma and kidney concentrations of cromolyn after oral administration to neonatal rats were up to 20 times greater than those in older rats. In term infants up to six months of age, available clinical data suggest that the dose should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. The use of this product in pediatric patients less than two years of age should be reserved for patients with severe disease in which the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits sensitized mast cell degranulation which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of mediators from mast cells. Studies show that cromolyn sodium indirectly blocks calcium ions from entering the mast cell, thereby preventing mediator release. Cromolyn sodium inhibits both the immediate and non-immediate bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled antigen. Cromolyn sodium also attenuates bronchospasm caused by exercise, toluene diisocyanate, aspirin, cold air, sulfur dioxide, and environmental pollutants. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic bronchodilator or antihistamine activity. After administration by inhalation, approximately 8% of the total cromolyn sodium dose administered is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged, approximately equally divided between urine and bile. The remainder of the dose is either exhaled or deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed and excreted via the alimentary tract."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP is a prophylactic agent indicated in the management of patients with bronchial asthma. In patients whose symptoms are sufficiently frequent to require a continuous program of medication, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP is given by inhalation on a regular daily basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is usually evident after several weeks of treatment, although some patients show an almost immediate response. In patients who develop acute bronchoconstriction in response to exposure to exercise, toluene diisocyanate, environmental pollutants, etc., cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be given shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Occasionally, patients may experience cough and/or bronchospasm following inhalation of cromolyn sodium. At times, patients who develop bronchospasm may not be able to continue cromolyn sodium administration despite prior bronchodilator administration. Rarely, very severe bronchospasm has been encountered. Symptoms of asthma may recur if cromolyn sodium is reduced below the recommended dosage or discontinued. Information for Patients Cromolyn sodium is to be taken as directed by the physician. Because it is preventive medication, it may take up to four weeks before the patient experiences maximum benefit. Cromolyn sodium should be used in a power-driven nebulizer with an adequate airflow rate equipped with a suitable face mask or mouthpiece. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled Living a Full Life with Asthma. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous treatment at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. These doses correspond to approximately 1.0, 0.3, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 18 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg and 164 mg/kg, respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg produced no evidence of fetal malformations. These doses represent approximately 27, 17, and 98 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice. Cromolyn sodium alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations. Isoproterenol alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) increased both resorptions and malformations. The addition of cromolyn sodium (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) to isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when cromolyn sodium is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials; however, a causal relationship could not be established: drowsiness, nasal itching, nose bleed, nose burning, serum sickness, and stomachache. In addition, adverse reactions have been reported with cromolyn sodium for inhalation capsules. The most common side effects are associated with inhalation of the powder and include transient cough (1 in 5 patients) and mild wheezing (1 in 25 patients). These effects rarely require treatment or discontinuation of the drug. Information on the incidence of adverse reactions to cromolyn sodium for inhalation capsules has been derived from U.S. postmarketing surveillance experience. The following adverse reactions attributed to cromolyn sodium, based upon recurrence following readministration, have been reported in less than 1 in 10,000 patients: laryngeal edema, swollen parotid gland, angioedema, bronchospasm, joint swelling and pain, dizziness, dysuria and urinary frequency, nausea, cough, wheezing, headache, nasal congestion, rash, urticaria and lacrimation. Other adverse reactions have been reported in less than 1 in 100,000 patients, and it is unclear whether these are attributable to the drug: anaphylaxis, nephrosis, periarteritic vasculitis, pericarditis, peripheral neuritis, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, polymyositis, exfoliative dermatitis, hemoptysis, anemia, myalgia, hoarseness, photodermatitis, and vertigo.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE There is no clinical syndrome associated with an overdosage of cromolyn sodium. Acute toxicity testing in a wide variety of species has demonstrated that toxicity with cromolyn sodium occurs only with very high exposure levels, regardless of whether administration was parenteral, oral or by inhalation. Parenteral administration in mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits demonstrated a median lethal dose of approximately 4000 mg/kg. Intravenous administration in monkeys also indicated a similar pattern of toxicity. The highest dose administered by the oral route in rats and mice was 8000 mg/kg, (approximately 261 and 130 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m 2 basis) and at this dose level no deaths occurred. By inhalation, even in long term studies, it proved impossible to achieve toxic dose levels of cromolyn sodium in a range of mammalian species."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For management of bronchial asthma in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one ampule administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals. Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Patients with chronic asthma should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately. For the prevention of acute bronchospasm which follows exercise or exposure to cold dry air, environmental agents ( e.g. , animal danders, toluene diisocyanate, pollutants), etc., the usual dose is the contents of one ampule administered by nebulization shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor. It should be emphasized to the patient that the drug is poorly absorbed when swallowed and is not effective by this route of administration. For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled \u201c Living a Full Life with Asthma\u201d . Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma: Non-steroidal agents Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen ( e.g. , bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually. If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three ampules per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four ampules per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates. Corticosteroids In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma. It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma. It is particularly important that great care be exercised if, for any reason, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is withdrawn in cases where its use has permitted a reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. In such cases, continued close supervision of the patient is essential since there may be sudden reappearance of severe manifestations of asthma which will require immediate therapy and possible reintroduction of corticosteroids."

      "LIVING A FULL LIFE WITH ASTHMA PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS CROMOLYN SODIUM INHALATION SOLUTION USP You or your child may be among the millions of Americans who have asthma. For most patients, asthma need not limit your lifestyle, if you closely follow the asthma management plan your doctor provides you. Your doctor has given you this instruction sheet to help you learn more about asthma and ways to control it. WHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a disease that causes patients to have difficulty breathing. Asthma \u201cattacks\u201d occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from passing through. The closing up is caused by two things: The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This swelling is caused by a certain type of inflammation that can build up in the airways of patients with asthma. Inflammation and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur. WHAT CAUSES THESE ATTACKS? Asthma experts know that patients with asthma have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or \u201ctriggers\u201d, such as cold dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with asthma may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often. Asthma triggers fall into 6 categories: Substances that cause allergies (pollens, animal dander, molds, house dust, some foods and medicines) Infections that affect breathing (colds, flu) Emotional stress (difficult situations at home, school, or work) Strenuous exercise Irritating gases (chlorine, perfume, tobacco smoke) Sudden changes in temperature or humidity HOW TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS No medicine or procedure will \u201ccure\u201d asthma. The key to asthma relief, therefore, is to prevent attacks and to relieve attack symptoms if they do occur. A successful prevention plan* will do the following: Keep your activities, including exercise, at normal levels. Keep your lungs functioning normally or at a near- normal level. Prevent symptoms such as coughing or breathlessness that can keep you up at night, or occur in the early morning hours, or after exertion. Prevent asthma attacks from happening. Avoid unpleasant or harmful side effects that may result from using asthma medicine. The best way to prevent asthma attacks is to avoid the triggers that bother you or your child. Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks. If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin- like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do. * Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. National Asthma Education Program, Expert Panel Report, 1991. OTHER DO\u2019S AND DON\u2019TS Anyone with asthma should stick to a healthy, balanced diet, get lots of rest and moderate exercise, and follow these do\u2019s and don\u2019ts: Don\u2019t smoke, and don\u2019t stay in the same room with people that do. Avoid fresh paint. Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Don\u2019t go in and out of extremely cool air-conditioned buildings during hot weather. Stay home in extremely cold weather, if possible. Stay away from people with cold or flu. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting situations. Drink lots of liquids. Don\u2019t overdo, but follow a regular exercise plan, including activities that help develop lung capacity. Don\u2019t take any medicine on your own without asking your doctor first. Take all medicines your doctor prescribes, as much and as often as you are told. Avoid taking sleeping pills or sedatives, even if asthma keeps you awake. Prop yourself up with extra pillows until your asthma medicine takes effect. Avoid breathing in insecticides, deodorants, cleaning fluids, chlorine, or other irritating gases. ASTHMA MEDICINES Preventive Medicine Your doctor knows that, besides relieving an attack when it happens, it is also important to prevent attacks from occurring in the first place. Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents asthma attacks by making airways less sensitive to asthma triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an asthma attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause inflammation and asthma attacks. By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent asthma attacks. Bronchodilators When someone is having an asthma attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve asthma attacks. Your doctor may have already prescribed this medicine for you to use at that time. HOW WILL CROMOLYN SODIUM WORK FOR YOU? To get the best possible results, follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully when you first take cromolyn sodium. Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium, regularly , as often as your doctor recommends, even though you have no asthma symptoms at the time. Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of inflammation in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your asthma under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor. When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you wheeze or cough, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you prevent asthma attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress. While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks. While taking cromolyn sodium, you should continue taking your other medications until your doctor advises you otherwise. HOW TO TAKE CROMOLYN SODIUM Be sure to follow instructions carefully when you are shown how to take cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. CARE AND STORAGE Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be stored at 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Retain in rondo tray until time of use. PROTECT FROM LIGHT. Do not use if it contains a precipitate (particles or cloudiness) or becomes discolored. NOTE: In case of difficulty consult your doctor or pharmacist. image 1 image 2 image 3 image 4 image 5"

Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent asthma attacks.   If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin- like pain relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do.   * Adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.

Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents asthma attacks by making airways less sensitive to asthma triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an asthma attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause inflammation and asthma attacks.   By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent asthma attacks.  <content styleCode=\"bold\">Bronchodilators</content>  When someone is having an asthma attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve asthma attacks.

Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. <content styleCode=\"bold\">It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium, <content styleCode=\"italics\">regularly</content>, as often as your doctor recommends, even though you have no asthma symptoms at the time. </content>Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of inflammation in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your asthma under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor.   When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you wheeze or cough, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you <content styleCode=\"italics\">prevent</content>asthma attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress.   While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and SRS-A (slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis) from the mast cell. Another activity demonstrated in vitro is the capacity of cromolyn sodium to inhibit the degranulation of non-sensitized rat mast cells by phospholipase A and the subsequent release of chemical mediators. Another study showed that cromolyn sodium did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of released phospholipase A on its specific substrate. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistaminic or anti-inflammatory activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed. When multiple doses of cromolyn sodium ophthalmic solution are instilled into normal rabbit eyes, less than 0.07% of the administered dose of cromolyn sodium is absorbed into the systemic circulation (presumably by way of the eye, nasal passages, buccal cavity and gastrointestinal tract). Trace amounts (less than 0.01%) of the cromolyn sodium dose penetrate into the aqueous humor and clearance from this chamber is virtually complete within 24 hours after treatment is stopped. In normal volunteers, analysis of drug excretion indicates that approximately 0.03% of cromolyn sodium is absorbed following administration to the eye."

Do not wear contact lenses during treatment with Cromolyn Sodium Ophthalmic Solution USP, 4%. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 52.6 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous administration at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. The average daily maximum dose levels administered in these studies were 192.9 mg/m 2 for mice, 47.2 mg/m 2 for hamsters and 385.8 mg/m 2 for rats. These doses correspond to approximately 6.8, 1.7 and 14 times the maximum daily human dose of 28 mg/m 2 . Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella /microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomycas cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day (1050 mg/m 2 ) in males and 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m 2 ) in females. These doses are approximately 37 and 21 times the maximum daily human dose, respectively, based on mg/m 2 . Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg (1620 mg/m 2 ) and 164 mg/kg (984 mg/m 2 ), respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg (5820 mg/m 2 ) produced no evidence of fetal malformation. These doses represent approximately 57, 35, and 205 times the maximum daily human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Ophthalmic Solution USP, 4% is administered to a nursing woman.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "In vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes (SRS-A) from the mast cell. Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic vasoconstrictor, antihistamine, or glucocorticoid activity. Cromolyn sodium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No more than 1% of an administered dose is absorbed by humans after oral administration, the remainder being excreted in the feces. Very little absorption of cromolyn sodium was seen after oral administration of 500 mg by mouth to each of 12 volunteers. From 0.28 to 0.50% of the administered dose was recovered in the first 24 hours of urinary excretion in 3 subjects. The mean urinary excretion of an administered dose over 24 hours in the remaining 9 subjects was 0.45%."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "Four randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis; two of which utilized a placebo-controlled crossover design, one utilized an active-controlled (chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine) crossover design, and one utilized a placebo-controlled parallel group design. Due to the rare nature of this disease, only 36 patients qualified for study entry, of whom 32 were considered evaluable. Consequently, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Clinically significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) were seen in the majority of patients with some improvement also seen for cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, pruritus, flushing) and cognitive function. The benefit seen with Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) 200 mg QID was similar to chlorpheniramine (4 mg QID) plus cimetidine (300 mg QID) for both cutaneous and systemic symptoms of mastocytosis. Clinical improvement occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted for 2-3 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not affect urinary histamine levels or peripheral eosinophilia, although neither of these variables appeared to correlate with disease severity. Positive clinical benefits were also reported for 37 of 51 patients who received Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) in United States and foreign humanitarian programs."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "In view of the biliary and renal routes of excretion of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate), consideration should be given to decreasing the dosage of the drug in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In carcinogenicity studies in mice, hamsters, and rats, cromolyn sodium had no neoplastic effects at intraperitoneal doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week for 12 months in mice, at intraperitoneal doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks in hamsters, and at subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week for 18 months in rats. These doses in mice, hamsters, and rats are less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m 2 basis. Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human peripheral lymphocytes. In rats, cromolyn sodium showed no evidence of impaired fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 175 mg/kg in males (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 100 mg/kg in females (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. In reproductive studies in pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, cromolyn sodium produced no evidence of fetal malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg in mice (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) and 164 mg/kg in rats (less than the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) or at intravenous doses up to 485 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: In pregnant mice, cromolyn sodium alone did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations at subcutaneous doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). Isoproterenol alone increased both resorptions and major malformations (primarily cleft palate) at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). The incidence of major malformations increased further when cromolyn sodium at a subcutaneous dose of 540 mg/kg was added to isoproterenol at a subcutaneous dose of 2.7 mg/kg. No such interaction was observed in rats or rabbits. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: In adult rats no adverse effects of cromolyn sodium were observed at oral doses up to 6144 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). In neonatal rats, cromolyn sodium increased mortality at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or greater (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis) but not at doses of 300 mg/kg or less (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in infants on a mg/m 2 basis). Plasma and kidney concentrations of cromolyn after oral administration to neonatal rats were up to 20 times greater than those in older rats. In term infants up to six months of age, available clinical data suggest that the dose should not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. The use of this product in pediatric patients less than two years of age should be reserved for patients with severe disease in which the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Cromolyn Sodium Oral Solution (Concentrate) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."
