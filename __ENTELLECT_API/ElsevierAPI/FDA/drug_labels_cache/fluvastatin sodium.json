    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs. Discontinue fluvastatin if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels occur, or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing fluvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. (5.1) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue fluvastatin if IMNM is suspected. (5.2) Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets (5.3) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Fluvastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including fluvastatin. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Avoid concomitant use of fluvastatin with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with fluvastatin, lipid modifying doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Discontinue fluvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if fluvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting fluvastatin. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue fluvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of fluvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1.1% of patients receiving fluvastatin in clinical trials. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with fluvastatin. There have been rare post-marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before fluvastatin initiation and thereafter, when clinically indicated. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including fluvastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most frequent adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 2.5% of subjects treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets and more than placebo are: influenza-like symptoms, sinusitis, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the fluvastatin capsule, clinical trials there were 2,326 patients treated with fluvastatin (age range, 18 to 75 years, 44% women, 94% White, 4% Black or African American, 2% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at an incidence greater than placebo were: transaminase increased (0.8%), upper abdominal pain (0.3%), dyspepsia (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%), and diarrhea (0.2%). In the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets clinical trials there were 912 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets (age range, 21 to 87 years, 52% women, 91% White, 4% Black of African American, 5% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were abdominal pain (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), dyspepsia (0.4%) and chest pain (0.3%). Adverse reactions occurring in the fluvastatin capsules and fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets controlled trials with a frequency 2% included the following: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials Pooled Dosages Adverse reaction Placebo a N = 960 (%) Fluvastatin capsulesa N = 2,326 (%) Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets b N = 912 (%) Influenza-like symptoms 5.7 5.1 7.1 Headache 7.8 8.9 4.7 Myalgia 4.5 5.0 3.8 Abdominal pain 3.8 4.9 3.7 Dyspepsia 3.2 7.9 3.5 Sinusitis 1.9 2.6 3.5 Diarrhea 4.2 4.9 3.3 Arthropathy NA NA 3.2 Urinary tract infection 1.1 1.6 2.7 Nausea 2.0 3.2 2.5 Bronchitis 1.0 1.8 2.6 Fatigue 2.3 2.7 1.6 Flatulence 2.5 2.6 1.4 Arthritis 2.0 2.1 1.3 Allergy 2.2 2.3 1.0 Insomnia 1.4 2.7 0.8 a Controlled trials with fluvastatin capsules (20 mg and 40 mg daily and 40 mg twice daily) compared to placebo. b Controlled trials with fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg Tablets as compared to fluvastatin capsules. In the Fluvastatin Capsule Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg, administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events was assessed in 1,677 patients with coronary heart disease who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in the LIPS Trial Adverse reaction Placebo N = 818 (%) Fluvastatin Capsules 40 mg twice daily N = 822 (%) Abdominal pain upper 4.5 6.3 Hypertension 4.2 5.8 Fatigue 3.8 4.7 Dyspepsia 4.0 4.5 Edema peripheral 2.9 4.4 Pain in extremity 2.7 4.1 Dizziness 3.5 3.9 Constipation 2.1 3.3 Nasopharyngitis 2.1 2.8 Dyspnea exertional 2.4 2.8 Gastric disorder 2.1 2.7 Nausea 2.3 2.7 Atrial fibrillation 2.0 2.4 Syncope 2.2 2.4 Bronchitis 2.0 2.3 Intermittent claudication 2.1 2.3 Myalgia 1.6 2.2 Arthralgia 1.8 2.1 Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules in clinical trials developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels to more than 3 times the ULN. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all clinical trials, a total of 33/2,969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks; 19 of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued. The majority of patients with these abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic. In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which fluvastatin capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (> 3 times the ULN on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with daily doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg twice daily) fluvastatin capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of persistent ALT/AST increased abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or by Week 8. In the pooled analysis of 24-week controlled trials, persistent transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8%, and 4.9% of patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg, fluvastatin capsules 40 mg and fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, myositis. There have been rare reports of IMNM associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Neurological: Dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, vertigo, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric: Anxiety, depression, psychic disturbances Respiratory: Interstitial lung disease Hypersensitivity reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity reaction, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, anorexia, vomiting, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure. Skin: Rash, dermatitis, including bullous dermatitis, eczema, alopecia, pruritus, lichen planus, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails). Reproductive: Gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction. Eye: Progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory abnormalities: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm (8.1) Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue fluvastatin when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. Fluvastatin decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, fluvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with fluvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered fluvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in 2 and 5 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dosage of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1,152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly preexisting diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Fluvastatin sodium given to rats during organogenesis at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day produced delays in skeletal development. These doses resulted in 2 times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or 5 times (rabbit at 10 mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m 2 surface area. Malaligned thoracic vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. A study in which female rats were given fluvastatin during the third trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality beginning at 6 mg/kg. Rats were given fluvastatin from Gestation Day 15 to Lactation Day 21 at doses of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on Days 0 and 7 postpartum. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information about the presence of fluvastatin in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. However, it has been shown that another drug in this class passes into human milk. Studies in rats have shown that fluvastatin and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data). Statins, including fluvastatin, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Data Following a single oral administration of 1 mg/kg of radioactive fluvastatin to lactating rats, the concentration of total radioactivity was determined. Fluvastatin and/or its metabolites were measured in the breast milk at a 2:1 ratio (milk:plasma). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of fluvastatin for this indication is based on open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials in 114 pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with HeFH. In these limited uncontrolled studies, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the males or females, or on menstrual cycle length in females. The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Fluvastatin exposures were not significantly different between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age \u2265 65 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Advanced age (\u2265 65 years) is a risk factor for fluvastatin-associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving fluvastatin for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment are not necessary. Fluvastatin has not been studied at doses greater than 40 mg in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, use fluvastatin with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Fluvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by fluvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of fluvastatin is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range, 9% to 66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (Tmax 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VDss) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Elimination Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. For fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, the AUC increases 67% and 77% for women compared to men under fasted and high-fat meal fed conditions, respectively. Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate release capsule. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and Cmax increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules. Similar studies have not been conducted using the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by fluvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of fluvastatin is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range, 9% to 66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (Tmax 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VDss) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Elimination Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. For fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, the AUC increases 67% and 77% for women compared to men under fasted and high-fat meal fed conditions, respectively. Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate release capsule. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and Cmax increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules. Similar studies have not been conducted using the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats at doses of 6, 9, and 18 to 24 (escalated after 1 year) mg/kg/day, there was an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in males treated with 18 to 24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, a low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and one forestomach carcinoma were observed at the 18 to 24 mg/kg/day dose, likely due to prolonged direct contact exposure rather than a systemic effect. This dose represents a plasma AUC exposure approximately 26 to 35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at doses of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in females at 15 mg/kg/day and in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day. These doses represent plasma AUC exposures approximately 2 and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in either a rat chromosome aberration study or mouse micronucleus test. In a fertility study in rats with daily doses up to 6 mg/kg/day for females and 20 mg/kg/day for males, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. Hamsters treated for 3 months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 mg human daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 ) showed small seminal vesicles and testes, along with tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in the testes and vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles. Rats treated for 2 years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately four times human exposure based on body surface area) exhibited vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles and edema in the testes."

Additionally, a low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and one forestomach carcinoma were observed at the 18 to 24 mg/kg/day dose, likely due to prolonged direct contact exposure rather than a systemic effect. This dose represents a plasma AUC exposure approximately 26 to 35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at doses of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in females at 15 mg/kg/day and in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day. These doses represent plasma AUC exposures approximately 2 and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in either a rat chromosome aberration study or mouse micronucleus test. In a fertility study in rats with daily doses up to 6 mg/kg/day for females and 20 mg/kg/day for males, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. Hamsters treated for 3 months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 mg human daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 ) showed small seminal vesicles and testes, along with tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in the testes and vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles. Rats treated for 2 years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately four times human exposure based on body surface area) exhibited vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles and edema in the testes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events (time to first occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization) was assessed in 1,677 adult patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (mean time from PCI to randomization = 3 days). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male, 98% White, with 37% > 65 years of age. Mean baseline lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 132 mg/dL, triglycerides 70 mg/dL, and HDL-C 39 mg/dL. Fluvastatin capsules significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiac events (Figure 1) by 22% (p = 0.013, 181 patients in the fluvastatin capsules group versus 222 patients in the placebo group). Revascularization procedures comprised the majority of the initial recurrent cardiac events (143 revascularization procedures in the fluvastatin capsules group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were observed in patients > 65 years of age. Figure 1. Primary Endpoint \u2013 Recurrent Cardiac Events (Cardiac Death, Nonfatal MI or Revascularization Procedure) (ITT Population) Outcome data for the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study are shown in Figure 2. After exclusion of revascularization procedures (CABG and repeat PCI) occurring within the first 6 months of the initial procedure involving the originally instrumental site, treatment with fluvastatin capsules was associated with a 32% (p = 0.002) reduction in risk of late revascularization procedures (CABG or PCI occurring at the original site > 6 months after the initial procedure, or at another site). Figure 2. Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study - Primary and Secondary Endpoints In the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), the effect of fluvastatin capsule therapy on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in patients with CAD and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (baseline LDL-C range 115 to 190 mg/dL). In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 429 patients were treated with conventional measures (Step 1, AHA Diet) and either fluvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo. In order to provide treatment to patients receiving placebo with LDL-C levels \u2265 160 mg/dL at baseline, adjunctive therapy with cholestyramine was added after Week 12 to all patients in the study with baseline LDL-C values of \u2265 160 mg/dL, which were present in 25% of the study population. Quantitative coronary angiograms were evaluated at baseline and 2.5 years in 340 (79%) angiographic evaluable patients. Compared to placebo, fluvastatin capsules significantly slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint (Figure 3 below), percent diameter stenosis (Figure 4), and the formation of new lesions (13% of all fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients). A significant difference in favor of fluvastatin capsules was found between all fluvastatin and all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change. Beneficial angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients\u2019 gender and consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels. Figure 3. Change in Minimum Lumen Diameter (mm) Figure 4. Change in % Diameter Stenosis Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets have been studied in five controlled trials of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were administered to over 900 patients in trials from 4 to 26 weeks in duration. In the three largest of these trials, fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets given as a single daily dose of 80 mg significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (Table 5). In patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia as defined by baseline plasma TG levels \u2265 200 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, treatment with fluvastatin produced significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (see Table 7).

HeFH in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older Fluvastatin capsules were studied in two open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trials. The first trial enrolled 29 pre-pubertal males, 9 to 12 years of age, who had an LDL-C level > 90th percentile for age and one parent with primary hypercholesterolemia and either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range, 137 to 354 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (40 mg twice daily) to achieve an LDL-C goal between 97 to 124 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range, 74 to 336 mg/dL). The second trial enrolled 85 male and female patients, 10 to 16 years of age, who had an LDL-C > 190 mg/dL or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225 mg/dL (range, 148 to 343 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (fluvastatin sodium 80 mg extended-release tablets) to achieve an LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Week 114. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 22% and 28%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 159 mg/dL (range, 90 to 295 mg/dL). The majority of patients in both trials (83% in the first trial and 89% in the second trial) were titrated to the maximum daily dose of 80 mg.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis : Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels occur, or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM) : Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if IMNM is suspected.( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets . Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Avoid concomitant use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, lipid modifying doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1.1% of patients receiving fluvastatin in clinical trials. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with fluvastatin. There have been rare post-marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets initiation and thereafter, when clinically indicated. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most frequent adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 2.5% of subjects treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets and more than placebo are: influenza-like symptoms, sinusitis, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the fluvastatin capsule, clinical trials there were 2326 patients treated with fluvastatin (age range, 18 to 75 years, 44% women, 94% White, 4% Black or African American, 2% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at an incidence greater than placebo were: transaminase increased (0.8%), upper abdominal pain (0.3%), dyspepsia (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%), and diarrhea (0.2%). In the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets clinical trials there were 912 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets (age range, 21 to 87 years, 52% women, 91% White, 4% Black of African American, 5% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were abdominal pain (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), dyspepsia (0.4%) and chest pain (0.3%). Adverse reactions occurring in the fluvastatin capsules and fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets controlled trials with a frequency \u2265 2% included the following: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/ Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials Pooled Dosages Adverse reaction Placebo a N = 960 (%) Fluvastatin capsules a N = 2326 (%) Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets b N = 912 (%) Influenza-like symptoms 5.7 5.1 7.1 Headache 7.8 8.9 4.7 Myalgia 4.5 5.0 3.8 Abdominal pain 3.8 4.9 3.7 Dyspepsia 3.2 7.9 3.5 Sinusitis 1.9 2.6 3.5 Diarrhea 4.2 4.9 3.3 Arthropathy NA NA 3.2 Urinary tract infection 1.1 1.6 2.7 Nausea 2.0 3.2 2.5 Bronchitis 1.0 1.8 2.6 Fatigue 2.3 2.7 1.6 Flatulence 2.5 2.6 1.4 Arthritis 2.0 2.1 1.3 Allergy 2.2 2.3 1.0 Insomnia 1.4 2.7 0.8 a Controlled trials with fluvastatin capsules (20 mg and 40 mg daily and 40 mg twice daily) compared to placebo. b Controlled trials with fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets as compared to fluvastatin capsules. In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg, administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events was assessed in 1677 patients with coronary heart disease who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/ Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in the LIPS Trial Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/ Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in the LIPS Trial Adverse reaction Placebo N = 818 (%) Fluvastatin Capsules 40 mg twice daily N = 822 (%) Abdominal pain upper 4.5 6.3 Hypertension 4.2 5.8 Fatigue 3.8 4.7 Dyspepsia 4.0 4.5 Edema peripheral 2.9 4.4 Pain in extremity 2.7 4.1 Dizziness 3.5 3.9 Constipation 2.1 3.3 Nasopharyngitis 2.1 2.8 Dyspnea exertional 2.4 2.8 Gastric disorder 2.1 2.7 Nausea 2.3 2.7 Atrial fibrillation 2.0 2.4 Syncope 2.2 2.4 Bronchitis 2.0 2.3 Intermittent claudication 2.1 2.3 Myalgia 1.6 2.2 Arthralgia 1.8 2.1 Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules in clinical trials developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels to more than 3 times the ULN. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all clinical trials, a total of 33/2969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks; 19 of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued. The majority of patients with these abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic. In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which fluvastatin capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (> 3 times the ULN on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with daily doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg twice daily) fluvastatin capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of persistent ALT/AST increased abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or by Week 8. In the pooled analysis of 24-week controlled trials, persistent transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8%, and 4.9% of patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg, fluvastatin capsules 40 mg and fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal : Muscle cramps, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, myositis. There have been rare reports of IMNM associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Neurological : Dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, vertigo, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric : Anxiety, depression, psychic disturbances Respiratory : Interstitial lung disease Hypersensitivity reactions : An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity reaction, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal : Pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, anorexia, vomiting, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure. Skin : Rash, dermatitis, including bullous dermatitis, eczema, alopecia, pruritus, lichen planus, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails). Reproductive : Gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction. Eye : Progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory abnormalities : elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets decrease synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets\u2019 use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered fluvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in 2 and 5 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dosage of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly preexisting diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Fluvastatin sodium given to rats during organogenesis at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day produced delays in skeletal development. These doses resulted in 2 times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or 5 times (rabbit at 10 mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m 2 surface area. Malaligned thoracic vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. A study in which female rats were given fluvastatin during the third trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality beginning at 6 mg/kg. Rats were given fluvastatin from Gestation Day 15 to Lactation Day 21 at doses of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on Days 0 and 7 postpartum. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information about the presence of fluvastatin in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. However, it has been shown that another drug in this class passes into human milk. Studies in rats have shown that fluvastatin and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data) . Statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Data Following a single oral administration of 1 mg/kg of radioactive fluvastatin to lactating rats, the concentration of total radioactivity was determined. Fluvastatin and/or its metabolites were measured in the breast milk at a 2:1 ratio (milk:plasma). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets for this indication is based on open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials in 114 pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with HeFH. In these limited uncontrolled studies, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the males or females, or on menstrual cycle length in females. The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Fluvastatin exposures were not significantly different between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age \u2265 65 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Advanced age (\u2265 65 years) is a risk factor for fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets -associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment are not necessary. Fluvastatin has not been studied at doses greater than 40 mg in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, use fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by fluvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range, 9% to 66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T max 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VD ss ) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Elimination Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. For fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, the AUC increases 67% and 77% for women compared to men under fasted and high- fat meal fed conditions, respectively. Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate release capsule. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and Cmax increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules. Similar studies have not been conducted using the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range, 9% to 66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T max 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VD ss ) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Elimination Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. For fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, the AUC increases 67% and 77% for women compared to men under fasted and high- fat meal fed conditions, respectively. Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate release capsule. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and Cmax increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules. Similar studies have not been conducted using the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats at doses of 6, 9, and 18 to 24 (escalated after 1 year) mg/kg/day, there was an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in males treated with 18 to 4 mg/kg/day. Additionally, a low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and one forestomach carcinoma were observed at the 18 to 24 mg/kg/day dose, likely due to prolonged direct contact exposure rather than a systemic effect. This dose represents a plasma AUC exposure approximately 26 to 35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at doses of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in females at 15 mg/kg/day and in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day. These doses represent plasma AUC exposures approximately 2 and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli ; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in either a rat chromosome aberration study or mouse micronucleus test. In a fertility study in rats with daily doses up to 6 mg/kg/day for females and 20 mg/kg/day for males, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. Hamsters treated for 3 months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 mg human daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 ) showed small seminal vesicles and testes, along with tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in the testes and vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles. Rats treated for 2 years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately four times human exposure based on body surface area) exhibited vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles and edema in the testes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events (time to first occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization) was assessed in 1677 adult patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (mean time from PCI to randomization = 3 days). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male, 98% White, with 37% > 65 years of age. Mean baseline lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 132 mg/dL, triglycerides 70 mg/dL, and HDL-C 39 mg/dL. Fluvastatin capsules significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiac events (Figure 1) by 22% (p = 0.013, 181 patients in the fluvastatin capsules group versus 222 patients in the placebo group). Revascularization procedures comprised the majority of the initial recurrent cardiac events (143 revascularization procedures in the fluvastatin capsules group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were observed in patients > 65 years of age. Figure 1. Primary Endpoint \u2013 Recurrent Cardiac Events (Cardiac Death, Nonfatal MI or Revascularization Procedure) (ITT Population) Outcome data for the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study are shown in Figure 2. After exclusion of revascularization procedures (CABG and repeat PCI) occurring within the first 6 months of the initial procedure involving the originally instrumental site, treatment with fluvastatin capsules was associated with a 32% (p = 0.002) reduction in risk of late revascularization procedures (CABG or PCI occurring at the original site > 6 months after the initial procedure, or at another site). Figure 2. Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study\u2013- Primary and Secondary Endpoints In the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), the effect of fluvastatin capsule therapy on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in patients with CAD and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (baseline LDL-C range 115 to 190 mg/dL). In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 429 patients were treated with conventional measures (Step 1, AHA Diet) and either fluvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo. In order to provide treatment to patients receiving placebo with LDL-C levels \u2265160 mg/dL at baseline, adjunctive therapy with cholestyramine was added after Week 12 to all patients in the study with baseline LDL-C values of \u2265 160 mg/dL, which were present in 25% of the study population. Quantitative coronary angiograms were evaluated at baseline and 2.5 years in 340 (79%) angiographic evaluable patients. Compared to placebo, fluvastatin capsules significantly slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint (Figure 3 below), percent diameter stenosis (Figure 4), and the formation of new lesions (13% of all fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients). A significant difference in favor of fluvastatin capsules was found between all fluvastatin and all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change. Beneficial angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients\u2019 gender and consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels. Figure 3. Change in Minimum Lumen Diameter (mm) Figure 4. Change in % Diameter Stenosis Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets have been studied in five controlled trials of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were administered to over 900 patients in trials from 4 to 26 weeks in duration. In the three largest of these trials, fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets given as a single daily dose of 80 mg significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (Table 5). In patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia as defined by baseline plasma TG levels \u2265 200 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets produced significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (see Table 7).

HeFH in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older Fluvastatin capsules were studied in two open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trials. The first trial enrolled 29 pre-pubertal males, 9 to12 years of age, who had an LDL-C level > 90 th percentile for age and one parent with primary hypercholesterolemia and either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range, 137 to 354 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (40 mg twice daily) to achieve an LDL-C goal between 97 to 124 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range, 74 to 336 mg/dL). The second trial enrolled 85 male and female patients, 10 to 16 years of age, who had an LDL-C > 190 mg/dL or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225 mg/dL (range, 148 to 343 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet) to achieve an LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Week 114. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 22% and 28%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 159 mg/dL (range, 90 to 295 mg/dL). The majority of patients in both trials (83% in the first trial and 89% in the second trial) were titrated to the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. lescol-03 lescol-04 lescol-05 lescol-06"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels occur, or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 ) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if IMNM is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was <0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Avoid concomitant use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, lipid modifying doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1.1% of patients receiving fluvastatin in clinical trials. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with fluvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets initiation and thereafter, when clinically indicated. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most frequent adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 2.5% of subjects treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets and more than placebo are: influenza-like symptoms, sinusitis, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the fluvastatin capsule, clinical trials there were 2326 patients treated with fluvastatin (age range, 18 to 75 years, 44% women, 94% White, 4% Black or African American, 2% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at an incidence greater than placebo were: transaminase increased (0.8%), upper abdominal pain (0.3%), dyspepsia (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%), and diarrhea (0.2%). In the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet clinical trials there were 912 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets (age range, 21 to 87 years, 52% women, 91% White, 4% Black or African American, 5% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were abdominal pain (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), dyspepsia (0.4%) and chest pain (0.3%). Adverse reactions occurring in the fluvastatin capsules and fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets controlled trials with a frequency \u22652% included the following: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials Pooled Dosages Adverse reaction Placebo a N = 960 (%) Fluvastatin capsules a N = 2326 (%) Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets b N = 912 (%) Influenza-like symptoms 5.7 5.1 7.1 Headache 7.8 8.9 4.7 Myalgia 4.5 5.0 3.8 Abdominal pain 3.8 4.9 3.7 Dyspepsia 3.2 7.9 3.5 Sinusitis 1.9 2.6 3.5 Diarrhea 4.2 4.9 3.3 Arthropathy NA NA 3.2 Urinary tract infection 1.1 1.6 2.7 Nausea 2.0 3.2 2.5 Bronchitis 1.0 1.8 2.6 Fatigue 2.3 2.7 1.6 Flatulence 2.5 2.6 1.4 Arthritis 2.0 2.1 1.3 Allergy 2.2 2.3 1.0 Insomnia 1.4 2.7 0.8 a. Controlled trials with fluvastatin capsules (20 mg and 40 mg daily and 40 mg twice daily) compared to placebo. b. Controlled trials with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, 80 mg as compared to fluvastatin capsules. In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg, administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events was assessed in 1677 patients with coronary heart disease who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n=844) or placebo (n=833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in the LIPS Trial. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin Capsules/Fluvastatin Sodium Extended-Release Tablets and at an Incidence Greater Than Placebo in the LIPS Trial Adverse reaction Placebo N = 818 (%) Fluvastatin Capsules 40 mg twice daily N = 822 (%) Abdominal pain upper 4.5 6.3 Hypertension 4.2 5.8 Fatigue 3.8 4.7 Dyspepsia 4.0 4.5 Edema peripheral 2.9 4.4 Pain in extremity 2.7 4.1 Dizziness 3.5 3.9 Constipation 2.1 3.3 Nasopharyngitis 2.1 2.8 Dyspnea exertional 2.4 2.8 Gastric disorder 2.1 2.7 Nausea 2.3 2.7 Atrial fibrillation 2.0 2.4 Syncope 2.2 2.4 Bronchitis 2.0 2.3 Intermittent claudication 2.1 2.3 Myalgia 1.6 2.2 Arthralgia 1.8 2.1 Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules in clinical trials developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels to more than 3 times the ULN. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all clinical trials, a total of 33/2969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks; 19 of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued. The majority of patients with these abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic. In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which fluvastatin capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (> 3 times the ULN on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with daily doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg twice daily) fluvastatin capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of persistent ALT/AST increased abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or by Week 8. In the pooled analysis of 24-week controlled trials, persistent transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8%, and 4.9% of patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg, fluvastatin capsules 40 mg and fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, myositis. There have been rare reports of IMNM associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Neurological: Dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, vertigo, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric: Anxiety, depression, psychic disturbances Respiratory: Interstitial lung disease Hypersensitivity reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity reaction, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, anorexia, vomiting, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure. Skin: Rash, dermatitis, including bullous dermatitis, eczema, alopecia, pruritus, lichen planus, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails). Reproductive: Gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction. Eye: Progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory abnormalities: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered fluvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in 2 and 5 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dosage of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly preexisting diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Fluvastatin sodium given to rats during organogenesis at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day produced delays in skeletal development. These doses resulted in 2 times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or 5 times (rabbit at 10 mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m 2 surface area. Malaligned thoracic vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. A study in which female rats were given fluvastatin during the third trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality beginning at 6 mg/kg. Rats were given fluvastatin from Gestation Day 15 to Lactation Day 21 at doses of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on Days 0 and 7 postpartum. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information about the presence of fluvastatin in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. However, it has been shown that another drug in this class passes into human milk. Studies in rats have shown that fluvastatin and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk ( see Data ). Statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Data Following a single oral administration of 1 mg/kg of radioactive fluvastatin to lactating rats, the concentration of total radioactivity was determined. Fluvastatin and/or its metabolites were measured in the breast milk at a 2:1 ratio (milk:plasma). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets for this indication is based on open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials in 114 pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with HeFH. In these limited uncontrolled studies, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the males or females, or on menstrual cycle length in females. The safety and effectiveness of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Fluvastatin exposures were not significantly different between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age \u226565 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Advanced age (\u226565 years) is a risk factor for fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets-associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment are not necessary. Fluvastatin has not been studied at doses greater than 40 mg in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, use fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (1 2.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by fluvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, 80 mg reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range, 9% to 66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T max 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VD ss ) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Elimination Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age >65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21 to 49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. For fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, the AUC increases 67% and 77% for women compared to men under fasted and high-fat meal fed conditions, respectively. Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr 10 to 40 mL/min), AUC and C max increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate release capsule. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and C max increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules. Similar studies have not been conducted using the fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablet.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats at doses of 6, 9, and 18 to 24 (escalated after 1 year) mg/kg/day, there was an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in males treated with 18 to 4 mg/kg/day. Additionally, a low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and one forestomach carcinoma were observed at the 18 to 24 mg/kg/day dose, likely due to prolonged direct contact exposure rather than a systemic effect. This dose represents a plasma AUC exposure approximately 26 to 35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at doses of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in females at 15 mg/kg/day and in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day. These doses represent plasma AUC exposures approximately 2 and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro , with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli ; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in either a rat chromosome aberration study or mouse micronucleus test. In a fertility study in rats with daily doses up to 6 mg/kg/day for females and 20 mg/kg/day for males, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. Hamsters treated for 3 months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 mg human daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 ) showed small seminal vesicles and testes, along with tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in the testes and vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles. Rats treated for 2 years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately four times human exposure based on body surface area) exhibited vesiculitis in the seminal vesicles and edema in the testes."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events (time to first occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization) was assessed in 1677 adult patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (mean time from PCI to randomization=3 days). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin 40 mg (n=844) or placebo (n=833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male, 98% White, with 37% >65 years of age. Mean baseline lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 132 mg/dL, triglycerides 70 mg/dL, and HDL-C 39 mg/dL. Fluvastatin capsules significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiac events (Figure 1) by 22% (p=0.013, 181 patients in the fluvastatin capsules group versus 222 patients in the placebo group). Revascularization procedures comprised the majority of the initial recurrent cardiac events (143 revascularization procedures in the fluvastatin capsules group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were observed in patients >65 years of age. Figure 1. Primary Endpoint \u2013 Recurrent Cardiac Events (Cardiac Death, Nonfatal MI or Revascularization Procedure) (ITT Population) Outcome data for the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study are shown in Figure 2. After exclusion of revascularization procedures (CABG and repeat PCI) occurring within the first 6 months of the initial procedure involving the originally instrumental site, treatment with fluvastatin capsules was associated with a 32% (p=0.002) reduction in risk of late revascularization procedures (CABG or PCI occurring at the original site > 6 months after the initial procedure, or at another site). Figure 2. Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study - Primary and Secondary Endpoints In the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), the effect of fluvastatin capsule therapy on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in patients with CAD and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (baseline LDL-C range 115 to 190 mg/dL). In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 429 patients were treated with conventional measures (Step 1, AHA Diet) and either fluvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo. In order to provide treatment to patients receiving placebo with LDL-C levels \u2265160 mg/dL at baseline, adjunctive therapy with cholestyramine was added after Week 12 to all patients in the study with baseline LDL-C values of \u2265160 mg/dL, which were present in 25% of the study population. Quantitative coronary angiograms were evaluated at baseline and 2.5 years in 340 (79%) angiographic evaluable patients. Compared to placebo, fluvastatin capsules significantly slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint (Figure 3 below), percent diameter stenosis (Figure 4), and the formation of new lesions (13% of all fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients). A significant difference in favor of fluvastatin capsules was found between all fluvastatin and all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change. Beneficial angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients\u2019 gender and consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels. Figure 3. Change in Minimum Lumen Diameter (mm) Figure 4. Change in % Diameter Stenosis Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets have been studied in five controlled trials of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were administered to over 900 patients in trials from 4 to 26 weeks in duration. In the three largest of these trials, fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets given as a single daily dose of 80 mg significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (Table 7). In patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia as defined by baseline plasma TG levels \u2265200 mg/dL and <400 mg/dL, treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets produced significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B (see Table 7).

HeFH in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older Fluvastatin capsules were studied in two open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trials. The first trial enrolled 29 pre-pubertal males, 9 to 12 years of age, who had an LDL-C level > 90 th percentile for age and one parent with primary hypercholesterolemia and either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range, 137 to 354 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (40 mg twice daily) to achieve an LDL-C goal between 97 to 124 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range, 74 to 336 mg/dL). The second trial enrolled 85 male and female patients, 10 to 16 years of age, who had an LDL-C >190 mg/dL or LDL-C >160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C >160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225 mg/dL (range, 148 to 343 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (fluvastatin sodium extended release tablet) to achieve an LDL-C goal of <130 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Week 114. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 22% and 28%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 159 mg/dL (range, 90 to 295 mg/dL). The majority of patients in both trials (83% in the first trial and 89% in the second trial) were titrated to the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. 2 3 4 5"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Dose range: 20 mg to 80 mg/day ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Fluvastatin capsules can be taken with or without food \u2022 Do not open fluvastatin capsules prior to administration ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adults: the recommended starting dose is 40 mg to 80 mg (administered as one fluvastatin 40 mg capsule twice daily) ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Do not take two fluvastatin 40 mg capsules at one time \u2022 Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (ages 10 to 16, inclusive): the recommended starting dose is fluvastatin capsule 20 mg once daily ( 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Dose range: 20 mg to 80 mg/day. Fluvastatin capsules can be administered orally as a single dose, with or without food. Do not open fluvastatin capsules prior to administration. Do not take two fluvastatin 40 mg capsules at one time. Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according to the patient\u2019s response to therapy and established treatment guidelines. For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of \u2265 25%, the recommended starting dose is 40 mg as one capsule in the evening, or 80 mg in divided doses of the 40 mg capsule given twice daily. For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of < 25% a starting dose of 20 mg may be used. 2.2 Adult Patients with Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia Adult patients can be started on fluvastatin capsules. The recommended starting dose for fluvastatin capsules is one 40 mg capsule in the evening, or one fluvastatin 40 mg capsule twice daily. Do not take two fluvastatin 40 mg capsules at one time. 2.3 Pediatric Patients (10-16 Years of Age) with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended starting dose is one 20 mg fluvastatin capsule. Dose adjustments, up to a maximum daily dose administered as fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily should be made at 6 week intervals. Doses should be individualized according to the goal of therapy [see NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines and Clinical Studies (14) ] 1 . 1 National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP): Highlights of the Report of the Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and Adolescents. Pediatrics. 89(3):495-501. 1992. 2.4 Use with Cyclosporine Do not exceed a dose of 20 mg b.i.d. fluvastatin in patients taking cyclosporine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 2.5 Use with Fluconazole Do not exceed a dose of 20 mg b.i.d. fluvastatin in patients taking fluconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication ( 4 ) \u2022 Active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations in serum transaminases ( 4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant ( 4 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Nursing mothers ( 4 , 8.3 ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity to Any Component of This Medication Fluvastatin capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. 4.2 Active Liver Disease Fluvastatin capsules are contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations in serum transaminases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 4.3 Pregnancy Fluvastatin capsules are contraindicated in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Fluvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Fluvastatin capsules should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, fluvastatin capsules should be discontinued and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 4.4 Nursing Mothers Fluvastatin is secreted into the breast milk of animals and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require treatment with fluvastatin capsules should be advised not to breastfeed their infants [see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase with advanced age (\u2265 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and combination use with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness and discontinue fluvastatin if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. ( 5.1 , 8.5 , 8.7 ) \u2022 Patients should be advised to report promptly any symptoms of myopathy. Fluvastatin therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): There have been rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with fluvastatin and other drugs in this class. Fluvastatin capsules should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy. These factors include advanced age (> 65 years), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism. The risk of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis with statins is increased with concurrent therapy with cyclosporine, erythromycin, fibrates or niacin. Myopathy was not observed in a clinical trial in 74 patients involving patients who were treated with fluvastatin together with niacin. Isolated cases of myopathy have been reported during postmarketing experience with concomitant administration of fluvastatin and colchicine. No information is available on the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and colchicine. Uncomplicated myalgia has also been reported in fluvastatin-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. In clinical trials, uncomplicated myalgia has been observed infrequently in patients treated with fluvastatin at rates indistinguishable from placebo. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CPK values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing fluvastatin. Fluvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Fluvastatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM. 5.3 Liver Enzymes Increases in serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including fluvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules in worldwide trials developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all clinical trials, a total of 33/2969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks; 19 of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued. The majority of patients with these abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic. In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which fluvastatin capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with daily doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg twice daily) fluvastatin capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of persistent liver function test abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or by Week 8. In the pooled analysis of the 24-week controlled trials, persistent transaminase elevation occurred in 1.8% and 4.9% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules 40 mg and fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily, respectively. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed prior to the initiation of fluvastatin, and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with fluvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart fluvastatin. In very rare cases, possibly drug-related hepatitis was observed that resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. 1 Active liver disease or unexplained serum transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of fluvastatin capsules [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Caution should be exercised when fluvastatin is administered to patients with a history of liver disease or heavy alcohol ingestion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Such patients should be closely monitored. 5.4 Endocrine Effects Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including fluvastatin. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower circulating cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Fluvastatin exhibited no effect upon non-stimulated cortisol levels and demonstrated no effect upon thyroid metabolism as assessed by measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Small declines in total serum testosterone have been noted in treated groups, but no commensurate elevation in LH occurred, suggesting that the observation was not due to a direct effect upon testosterone production. No effect upon FSH in males was noted. Due to the limited number of premenopausal females studied to date, no conclusions regarding the effect of fluvastatin upon female sex hormones may be made. Two clinical studies in patients receiving fluvastatin at doses up to 80 mg daily for periods of 24 to 28 weeks demonstrated no effect of treatment upon the adrenal response to ACTH stimulation. A clinical study evaluated the effect of fluvastatin at doses up to 80 mg daily for 28 weeks upon the gonadal response to HCG stimulation. Although the mean total testosterone response was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) relative to baseline in the 80 mg group, it was not significant in comparison to the changes noted in groups receiving either 40 mg of fluvastatin or placebo. Patients treated with fluvastatin who develop clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should be exercised if a statin or other agent used to lower cholesterol levels is administered to patients receiving other drugs (e.g., ketoconazole, spironolactone, cimetidine) that may decrease the levels of endogenous steroid hormones. 5.5 CNS Toxicity CNS effects, as evidenced by decreased activity, ataxia, loss of righting reflex, and ptosis were seen in the following animal studies: the 18-month mouse carcinogenicity study at 50 mg/kg/day, the 6-month dog study at 36 mg/kg/day, the 6-month hamster study at 40 mg/kg/day, and in acute, high-dose studies in rats and hamsters (50 mg/kg), rabbits (300 mg/kg) and mice (1500 mg/kg). CNS toxicity in the acute high-dose studies was characterized (in mice) by conspicuous vacuolation in the ventral white columns of the spinal cord at a dose of 5000 mg/kg and (in rats) by edema with separation of myelinated fibers of the ventral spinal tracts and sciatic nerve at a dose of 1500 mg/kg. CNS toxicity, characterized by periaxonal vacuolation, was observed in the medulla of dogs that died after treatment for 5 weeks with 48 mg/kg/day; this finding was not observed in the remaining dogs when the dose level was lowered to 36 mg/kg/day. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this drug class. No CNS lesions have been observed after chronic treatment for up to 2 years with fluvastatin in the mouse (at doses up to 350 mg/kg/day), rat (up to 24 mg/kg/day), or dog (up to 16 mg/kg/day). Prominent bilateral posterior Y suture lines in the ocular lens were seen in dogs after treatment with 1, 8, and 16 mg/kg/day for 2 years."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy (including myositis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . \u2022 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Most frequent adverse reactions (rate \u2265 2% and > placebo) are: headache, dyspepsia, myalgia, abdominal pain and nausea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical studies on fluvastatin are conducted in varying study populations and study designs, the frequency of adverse reactions observed in the clinical studies of fluvastatin cannot be directly compared with that in the clinical studies of other statins and may not reflect the frequency of adverse reactions observed in clinical practice. In the fluvastatin capsules placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 2326 patients treated with fluvastatin capsules (age range 18-75 years, 44% women, 94% Caucasians, 4% Blacks, 2% other ethnicities) with a median treatment duration of 24 weeks, 3.4% of patients on fluvastatin and 2.3% patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at an incidence greater than placebo were: transaminase increased (0.8%), upper abdominal pain (0.3%), dyspepsia (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%) and diarrhea (0.2%). Clinically relevant adverse experiences occurring in the fluvastatin capsules controlled studies with a frequency \u2265 2%, regardless of causality, included the following: Table 1: Clinical Adverse Events Reported in \u2265 2% in Patients Treated with Fluvastatin and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials Regardless of Causality (% of Patients) Pooled Dosages Fluvastatin Capsules Controlled trials with fluvastatin capsules (20 and 40 mg daily and 40 mg twice daily) compared to placebo N = 2326 (%) Placebo N = 960 (%) Musculoskeletal Myalgia 5.0 4.5 Arthritis 2.1 2.0 Arthropathy NA NA Respiratory Sinusitis 2.6 1.9 Bronchitis 1.8 1.0 Gastrointestinal Dyspepsia 7.9 3.2 Diarrhea 4.9 4.2 Abdominal pain 4.9 3.8 Nausea 3.2 2.0 Flatulence 2.6 2.5 Tooth disorder 2.1 1.7 Psychiatric Insomnia 2.7 1.4 Genitourinary Urinary tract infection 1.6 1.1 Headache 8.9 7.8 Influenza-like symptoms 5.1 5.7 Accidental Trauma 5.1 4.8 Fatigue 2.7 2.3 Allergy 2.3 2.2 Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study, the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg, administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events was assessed in 1677 patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ].

In two open-label, uncontrolled studies, 66 boys and 48 girls with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (9-16 years of age, 80% Caucasian, 19% Other [mixed ethnicity], 1% Asians) were treated with fluvastatin sodium administered as fluvastatin capsules 20 mg-40 mg twice daily, or fluvastatin 80 mg extended-release tablet [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions from spontaneous reports are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following effects have been reported with drugs in this class. Not all the effects listed below have necessarily been associated with fluvastatin sodium therapy. Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Neurological: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, dizziness, vertigo, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). Psychiatric: anxiety, insomnia, depression, psychic disturbances Respiratory: interstitial lung disease Hypersensitivity Reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity reaction, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, anorexia, vomiting, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure. Skin: rash, dermatitis, including bullous dermatitis, eczema, alopecia, pruritus, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails). Reproductive: gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction. Eye: progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory Abnormalities: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Cyclosporine: Combination increases fluvastatin exposure. Limit fluvastatin capsules dose to 20 mg ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Fluconazole: Combination increases fluvastatin exposure. Limit fluvastatin capsules dose to 20 mg ( 2.5 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with fluvastatin ( 5.1 , 7.3 , 7.4 ) \u2022 Glyburide: Monitor blood glucose levels when fluvastatin dose is changed ( 7 ) \u2022 Phenytoin: Monitor plasma phenytoin levels when fluvastatin treatment is initiated or when the dosage is changed ( 7 ) \u2022 Warfarin and coumarin derivatives: Monitor prothrombin times when fluvastatin coadministration is initiated, discontinued, or the dosage changed ( 7 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine coadministration increases fluvastatin exposure. Therefore, in patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to fluvastatin capsules 20 mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Fluconazole Administration of fluvastatin 40 mg single dose to healthy volunteers pre-treated with fluconazole for 4 days results in an increase of fluvastatin exposure. Therefore, in patients taking fluconazole, therapy should be limited to fluvastatin capsules 20 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of fluvastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided. 7.4 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, fluvastatin should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when fluvastatin is used in combination with lipid-modifying doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin; a reduction in fluvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.6 Glyburide Concomitant administration of fluvastatin and glyburide increased glyburide exposures. Patients on concomitant therapy of glyburide and fluvastatin should continue to be monitored appropriately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Phenytoin Concomitant administration of fluvastatin and phenytoin increased phenytoin exposures. Patients should continue to be monitored appropriately when fluvastatin therapy is initiated or when fluvastatin dose is changed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.8 Warfarin Bleeding and/or increased prothrombin times have been reported in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Therefore, patients receiving warfarin-type anticoagulants should have their prothrombin times closely monitored when fluvastatin sodium is initiated or the dosage of fluvastatin sodium is changed. 7.9 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fluvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fluvastatin with colchicine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X: Fluvastatin is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant [see Contraindications (4) ] . Lipid-lowering drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of use with fluvastatin during pregnancy. Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins. In a review 2 of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. The number of cases is adequate only to exclude a 3- to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89% of prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Teratology studies with fluvastatin in rats and rabbits showed maternal toxicity at high dose levels, but there was no evidence of embryotoxic or teratogenic potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) ]. Fluvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking fluvastatin capsules, the drug should be discontinued and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Based on animal data, fluvastatin is present in breast milk in a 2:1 ratio (milk:plasma). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing women should not take fluvastatin [see Contraindications (4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of fluvastatin in children and adolescent patients 9-16 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials for a duration of two years. The most common adverse events observed were influenza and infections. In these limited uncontrolled studies, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on fluvastatin therapy [see Contraindications (4) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Fluvastatin exposures were not significantly different between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age \u2265 65 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Since advanced age (\u2265 65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, fluvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Fluvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations in serum transaminases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Dose adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment are not necessary. Fluvastatin has not been studied at doses greater than 40 mg in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore caution should be exercised when treating such patients at higher doses [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

In the pediatric population, there have been reports of overdosage with fluvastatin sodium in children including a 2 year-old and the other 3 years of age, either of whom may have possibly ingested fluvastatin sodium. The maximum amount of fluvastatin sodium that could have been ingested was 80 mg (4 x 20 mg capsules). Vomiting was induced by ipecac in both children and no capsules were noted in their emesis. Neither child experienced any adverse symptoms and both recovered from the incident without problems. In the postmarketing experience there have been reports of accidental ingestion of fluvastatin tablets in infants up to 3 years of age. In one case, increased serum CPK values were noted. There have been reports of intentional overdose in adolescents with the development of hepatic enzyme elevations, convulsions and gastroenteritis/vomiting/diarrhea."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. The inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis reduces the cholesterol in hepatic cells, which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and thereby increases the uptake of LDL particles. The end result of these biochemical processes is a reduction of the plasma cholesterol concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of the capsule, fluvastatin reaches peak concentrations in less than 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability is 24% (range 9%-50%) after administration of a 10 mg dose. At steady state, administration of fluvastatin with the evening meal results in a 50% decrease in C max , an 11% decrease in AUC, and a more than 2-fold increase in T max as compared to administration 4 hours after the evening meal. No significant differences in the lipid-lowering effects were observed between the two administrations. After single or multiple doses above 20 mg, fluvastatin exhibits saturable first-pass metabolism resulting in more than dose proportional plasma fluvastatin concentrations. Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range: 9%-66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T max : 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VD ss ) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CL Cr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and C max increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment. However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate-release capsule. Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and C max increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose. The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Geriatric Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in AUC in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Drug-Drug Interactions Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. The inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis reduces the cholesterol in hepatic cells, which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and thereby increases the uptake of LDL particles. The end result of these biochemical processes is a reduction of the plasma cholesterol concentration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of the capsule, fluvastatin reaches peak concentrations in less than 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability is 24% (range 9%-50%) after administration of a 10 mg dose. At steady state, administration of fluvastatin with the evening meal results in a 50% decrease in C max , an 11% decrease in AUC, and a more than 2-fold increase in T max as compared to administration 4 hours after the evening meal. No significant differences in the lipid-lowering effects were observed between the two administrations. After single or multiple doses above 20 mg, fluvastatin exhibits saturable first-pass metabolism resulting in more than dose proportional plasma fluvastatin concentrations. Fluvastatin administered as fluvastatin sodium extended-release 80 mg tablets reaches peak concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet is approximately 29% (range: 9%-66%) compared to that of the fluvastatin immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T max : 6h) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%. However, the maximum concentration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets seen after a high-fat meal is less than the peak concentration following a single dose or twice daily dose of the 40 mg fluvastatin capsule. Distribution Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of distribution (VD ss ) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide. Metabolism Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Fluvastatin has two enantiomers. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner. In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin (approximately 75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved to a much less extent, i.e., approximately 5% and approximately 20%, respectively. Excretion Following oral administration, fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) excreted in the feces as metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Approximately 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose were recovered in urine. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluvastatin is approximately 3 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CL Cr 10-40 mL/min), AUC and C max increased approximately 1.2-fold after administration of a single dose of 40 mg fluvastatin compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the AUC increased by approximately 1.5-fold. Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets were not evaluated in patients with renal impairment. However, systemic exposures after administration of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets are lower than after the 40 mg immediate-release capsule. Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis, fluvastatin AUC and C max increased approximately 2.5-fold compared to healthy subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose. The enantiomer ratios of the two isomers of fluvastatin in hepatic impairment patients were comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Geriatric Plasma levels of fluvastatin are not significantly different in patients age > 65 years compared to patients age 21 to 49 years. Gender In a study evaluating the effect of age and gender on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, there were no significant differences in fluvastatin exposures between males and females, except between younger females and younger males (both ages 21-49 years), where there was an approximate 30% increase in AUC in females. Adjusting for body weight decreases the magnitude of the differences seen. Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Drug-Drug Interactions Data from drug-drug interactions studies involving coadministration of gemfibrozil, niacin, itraconazole, erythromycin, tolbutamide or clopidogrel indicate that the PK disposition of fluvastatin is not significantly altered when fluvastatin is coadministered with any of these drugs. The below listed drug interaction information is derived from studies using fluvastatin capsules.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 2-year study was performed in rats at dose levels of 6, 9, and 18-24 (escalated after 1 year) mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels of approximately 9, 13, and 26-35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and 1 carcinoma of the forestomach at the 24 mg/kg/day dose level was considered to reflect the prolonged hyperplasia induced by direct contact exposure to fluvastatin sodium rather than to a systemic effect of the drug. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas was recorded for males treated with 18-24 mg/kg/day. The increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell neoplasm in male rats with fluvastatin sodium appears to be consistent with findings from other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, no hepatic adenomas or carcinomas were observed. The carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at dose levels of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed, as in rats, a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day and in females at 15 mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels of approximately 0.05, 2, and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro , with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli ; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in vivo in either a rat or mouse micronucleus test. In a study in rats at dose levels for females of 0.6, 2 and 6 mg/kg/day and at dose levels for males of 2, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. Seminal vesicles and testes were small in hamsters treated for 3 months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 ). There was tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in testes as well as vesiculitis of seminal vesicles. Vesiculitis of seminal vesicles and edema of the testes were also seen in rats treated for 2 years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the human C max achieved with a 40 mg daily dose). Fluvastatin sodium produced delays in skeletal development in rats at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day. Malaligned thoracic vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, a dose that produced maternal toxicity. These doses resulted in 2 times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or 5 times (rabbit at 10 mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m 2 surface area. A study in which female rats were dosed during the third trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality beginning at 6 mg/kg. A modified Segment III study was performed at dose levels of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on days 0 and 7 postpartum."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia In 12 placebo-controlled studies in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, fluvastatin was administered to 1621 patients in daily dose regimens of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) for at least 6 weeks duration (Table 5). After 24 weeks of treatment, treatment with fluvastatin resulted in significantly reduced plasma LDL-C, TC, TG, and Apo B compared to placebo and was associated with variable increases in HDL-C across the dose range. In patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia as defined by baseline plasma TG levels \u2265 200 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, treatment with fluvastatin produced significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG and Apo B and variable increases in HDL-C (Table 5).

The first study enrolled 29 pre-pubertal boys, 9-12 years of age, who had an LDL-C level > 90th percentile for age and one parent with primary hypercholesterolemia and either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range: 137-354 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (40 mg b.i.d.) to achieve an LDL-C goal between 96.7 - 123.7 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range: 74-336 mg/dL). The second study enrolled 85 male and female patients, 10 to 16 years of age, who had an LDL-C > 190 mg/dL or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225 mg/dL (range: 148-343 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily then 80 mg daily (fluvastatin sodium 80 mg extended-release tablet) to achieve an LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Week 114. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 22% and 28%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 159 mg/dL (range: 90-295 mg/dL). The majority of patients in both studies (83% in the first study and 89% in the second study) were titrated to the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. At study endpoint, 26% to 30% of patients in both studies achieved a targeted LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL. The long-term efficacy of fluvastatin capsules therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established. 14.3 Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study, the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events (time to first occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization) was assessed in 1677 patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (mean time from PCI to randomization = 3 days). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male, 98% Caucasian, with 37% > 65 years of age. Mean baseline lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 132 mg/dL, triglycerides 70 mg/dL and HDL-C 39 mg/dL. Fluvastatin capsules significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiac events (Figure 1) by 22% (p = 0.013, 181 patients in the fluvastatin capsules group vs. 222 patients in the placebo group). Revascularization procedures comprised the majority of the initial recurrent cardiac events (143 revascularization procedures in the fluvastatin capsules group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were observed in patients > 65 years of age. Figure 1: Primary Endpoint - Recurrent Cardiac Events (Cardiac Death, Nonfatal MI or Revascularization Procedure) (ITT Population) Outcome data for the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study are shown in Figure 2. After exclusion of revascularization procedures (CABG and repeat PCI) occurring within the first 6 months of the initial procedure involving the originally instrumental site, treatment with fluvastatin capsules was associated with a 32% (p = 0.002) reduction in risk of late revascularization procedures (CABG or PCI occurring at the original site > 6 months after the initial procedure, or at another site). Figure 2: Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study - Primary and Secondary Endpoints In the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), the effect of fluvastatin capsules therapy on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in patients with CAD and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (baseline LDL-C range 115-190 mg/dL). In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 429 patients were treated with conventional measures (Step 1 AHA Diet) and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg/day or placebo. In order to provide treatment to patients receiving placebo with LDL-C levels \u2265 160 mg/dL at baseline, adjunctive therapy with cholestyramine was added after Week 12 to all patients in the study with baseline LDL-C values of \u2265 160 mg/dL which were present in 25% of the study population. Quantitative coronary angiograms were evaluated at baseline and 2.5 years in 340 (79%) angiographic evaluable patients. Compared to placebo, fluvastatin capsules significantly slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint (Figure 3 below), percent diameter stenosis (Figure 4), and the formation of new lesions (13% of all fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients). A significant difference in favor of fluvastatin capsules was found between all fluvastatin and all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change. Beneficial angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients\u2019 gender and consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels.
