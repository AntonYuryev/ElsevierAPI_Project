      "WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY \u2022 If THALOMID is taken during pregnancy, it can cause severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. THALOMID should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could be pregnant while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. \u2022 Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy thereafter by the use of two reliable methods of contraception. ( 5.1 , 8.3 ) THALOMID is only available through a restricted distribution program, the THALOMID REMS \u00ae program ( 5.2 ). VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM \u2022 Significant increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with multiple myeloma receiving THALOMID with dexamethasone ( 5.3 ). EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY If THALOMID is taken during pregnancy, it can cause severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. THALOMID should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could become pregnant while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of embryo-fetal exposure to THALOMID as negligible as possible, THALOMID is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program: THALOMID REMS program, approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Information about THALOMID and the THALOMID REMS program is available at www.thalomidrems.com or by calling the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436. VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM The use of THALOMID in multiple myeloma results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This risk increases significantly when THALOMID is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 MM: 200 mg orally once daily. The recommended dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg/day on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 28 days. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 ENL: 100 to 300 mg/day for an episode of cutaneous ENL. Up to 400 mg/day for severe cutaneous ENL. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Required Baseline Testing Drug prescribing to females of reproductive potential is contingent upon initial and continued negative results of pregnancy testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2) ] . THALOMID must only be administered in compliance with all of the terms outlined in the THALOMID REMS program. THALOMID may only be prescribed by prescribers certified with the THALOMID REMS program and may only be dispensed by pharmacists certified with the THALOMID REMS program. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Multiple Myeloma The recommended dose of THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone is 200 mg once daily (in 28-day treatment cycles) orally with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal. The dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg daily administered orally on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 28 days. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum The recommended dose of THALOMID for an episode of cutaneous ENL is 100 to 300 mg/day once daily orally with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal. Initiate dosing for patients weighing less than 50 kilograms at the low end of the dose range. Consider dosing in the higher dosage range for patients with a severe cutaneous ENL reaction, or in those who have previously required higher doses to control the reaction (possibly up to 400 mg/day) once daily at bedtime or in divided doses with water, at least 1 hour after meals. Consider concomitant use of corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe neuritis associated with a severe ENL reaction. Steroid usage can be tapered and discontinued when the neuritis has ameliorated. Continue dosing with THALOMID until signs and symptoms of active reaction have subsided, usually a period of at least 2 weeks. Patients may then be tapered off medication in 50 mg decrements every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have a documented history of requiring prolonged maintenance treatment to prevent the recurrence of cutaneous ENL or who flare during tapering should be maintained on the minimum dose necessary to control the reaction. Tapering off medication should be attempted every 3 to 6 months, in decrements of 50 mg every 2 to 4 weeks. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Interrupt THALOMID for constipation, somnolence, or peripheral neuropathy. Consider a reduced dose upon resumption of treatment. Consider dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation in patients who develop National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions and/or based on clinical judgment. Permanently discontinue THALOMID for angioedema, anaphylaxis, Grade 4 rash, skin exfoliation, bullae, or any other severe dermatologic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12 and 5.16) ] ."

THALOMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . THALOMID is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even after a single dose [see Boxed Warning ] . Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during THALOMID treatment, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 4.2 Hypersensitivity THALOMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its components [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction) and stroke have been observed in patients treated with THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Increased Mortality: Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Drowsiness and Somnolence: Instruct patients to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Peripheral Neuropathy: Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during treatment. Discontinue THALOMID if symptoms of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy occur, if clinically appropriate. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension: Advise patients to sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. ( 5.8 , 5.9 ) \u2022 Increased HIV Viral Load: Measure viral load during treatment. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Bradycardia: Monitor patients for bradycardia and possible syncope. Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue THALOMID for severe reactions.

( 5.13 ) \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Monitor patients at risk (e.g., those with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions. ( 5.14 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity. Discontinue THALOMID for angioedema and anaphylaxis. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity THALOMID is a powerful human teratogen that induces a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even after a single dose. Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. When there is no satisfactory alternative treatment, females of reproductive potential may be treated with THALOMID provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy. THALOMID is only available through the THALOMID REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Oral ingestion is the only type of maternal THALOMID exposure known to result in drug-associated birth defects. There are no specific data available regarding the reproductive risks of cutaneous absorption or inhalation of THALOMID; however, females of reproductive potential should avoid contact with THALOMID Capsules. THALOMID Capsules should be stored in blister packs until ingestion. If there is contact with non-intact THALOMID capsules or the powder contents, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water. If healthcare providers or other care givers are exposed to body fluids from patients receiving THALOMID, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water. Appropriate precautions should be utilized, such as wearing gloves to prevent the potential cutaneous exposure to THALOMID. Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning THALOMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Males Thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving THALOMID. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing THALOMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with THALOMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to THALOMID. 5.2 THALOMID REMS Program Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], THALOMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the THALOMID REMS program. Required components of the THALOMID REMS program include the following: \u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. \u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. \u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive THALOMID and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about the THALOMID REMS program is available at www.thalomidrems.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism The use of THALOMID in patients with MM results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This risk increases significantly when THALOMID is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Ischemic heart disease (11.1%), including myocardial infarction (1.3%), and stroke (cerebrovascular accident, 2.6%) have also occurred in patients with previously untreated MM treated with THALOMID and dexamethasone compared to placebo and dexamethasone (4.7%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively) in one clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors. Patients and physicians should be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling [see Boxed Warning ] . Agents that also may increase the risk of thromboembolism should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ]. 5.4 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.5 Drowsiness and Somnolence THALOMID frequently causes drowsiness and somnolence. Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness without adequate medical advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Advise patients as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating other complex or dangerous machinery. Dose reductions may be required. 5.6 Peripheral Neuropathy THALOMID is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (\u226510%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with THALOMID that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Symptoms may occur some time after THALOMID treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all. Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term THALOMID treatment. However, the inability clinically to differentiate THALOMID neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in ENL makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of THALOMID-related neuropathy in patients with ENL treated with THALOMID. Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of THALOMID therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet. Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment. Patients should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, THALOMID should be discontinued immediately to limit further damage, if clinically appropriate. Usually, treatment with THALOMID should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status. Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. 5.7 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should also be advised that THALOMID may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that, therefore, they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position. 5.8 Neutropenia Decreased white blood cell counts, including neutropenia, have been reported in association with the clinical use of THALOMID. Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <750/mm 3 . White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia, such as patients who are HIV-seropositive. If ANC decreases to below 750/mm 3 while on treatment, the patient's medication regimen should be re-evaluated and, if the neutropenia persists, consideration should be given to withholding THALOMID if clinically appropriate. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia, including Grade 3 or 4 occurrences, has been reported in association with the clinical use of THALOMID. Monitor blood counts, including platelet counts. Dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation may be required. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding including petechiae, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if concomitant medication may increase the risk of bleeding. 5.10 Increased HIV Viral Load In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of thalidomide in an HIV-seropositive patient population, plasma HIV RNA levels were found to increase (median change = 0.42 log 10 copies HIV RNA/mL, p = 0.04 compared to placebo). A similar trend was observed in a second, unpublished study conducted in patients who were HIV-seropositive. The clinical significance of this increase is unknown. Both studies were conducted prior to availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Until the clinical significance of this finding is further understood, in HIV-seropositive patients, viral load should be measured after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. 5.11 Bradycardia Bradycardia in association with THALOMID use has been reported. Cases of bradycardia have been reported, some required medical interventions. The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia noted in some THALOMID-treated patients are presently unknown. Monitor patients for bradycardia and syncope. Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required. Medications known to decrease heart rate should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.12 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with THALOMID use. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These events can be fatal. THALOMID interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Discontinue THALOMID for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN, or DRESS, and do not resume therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.13 Seizures Although not reported from pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, seizures, including grand mal convulsions, have been reported during post-approval use of THALOMID in clinical practice. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity, and it is not currently known whether THALOMID has any epileptogenic influence. During therapy with THALOMID, patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be monitored closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity. 5.14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitor patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions. 5.15 Contraceptive Risks Some contraceptive methods may pose a higher risk of adverse effects or may be medically contraindicated in some patients treated with THALOMID. Because some patients may develop sudden, severe neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) or implantable contraception in these patients may carry an increased risk for infection or bleeding either at insertion, removal or during use. Treatment with THALOMID, the presence of an underlying malignancy, and/or use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive can each increase the risk of thromboembolism. It is not known if these risks of thromboembolism are additive. However, they should be taken into consideration when choosing contraceptive methods. 5.16 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including angioedema and anaphylactic reactions to THALOMID has been reported. Signs and symptoms have included the occurrence of erythematous macular rash, possibly associated with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and if severe, may necessitate interruption of therapy. If the reaction recurs when dosing is resumed, THALOMID should be discontinued. Do not resume THALOMID treatment after angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] ."

The published literature describes the treatment of an additional 1678 patients. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of the individuals having adverse reactions, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary/terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table. Due to the fact that these data were collected from uncontrolled studies, the incidence rate cannot be determined.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Use caution if other drugs which have sedative and hypnotic properties, slow cardiac conduction and/or cause peripheral neuropathy must be used. ( 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.3 ) \u2022 It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID. ( 5.15 , 7.4 ) \u2022 Patients taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies may have an increased risk of thromboembolism. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol) The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive sedative effect and should be avoided. 7.2 Drugs which Cause Bradycardia The use of drugs which slow cardiac conduction concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive bradycardic effect and should be used with caution. Cardiovascular medications which may cause bradycardia include calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, alpha/beta-adrenergic blockers, and digoxin. Non-cardiac drugs that may cause bradycardia include H2 blockers (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), lithium, tricyclic antidepressants and neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine). In 16 healthy men, the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 0.5 mg digoxin dose was similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day at steady state levels. The single dose of digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of THALOMID. The safety of long-term concomitant use of THALOMID and digoxin has not been evaluated. 7.3 Drugs which Cause Peripheral Neuropathy The use of drugs which cause peripheral neuropathy (e.g., bortezomib, amiodarone, cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, disulfiram, phenytoin, metronidazole, alcohol) can cause an additive effect and should be used with caution. 7.4 Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of thromboembolism. It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID. In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were studied. The results were similar with and without coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day to steady-state levels. 7.5 Warfarin In 13 healthy men, the pharmacokinetic profile and international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time for warfarin, following a single oral dose of 25 mg, were similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day at steady-state levels. The single dose of warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of thalidomide. 7.6 Drugs that Interfere with Hormonal Contraceptives Concomitant use of HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies. Therefore, females requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two OTHER effective or highly effective methods of contraception while taking THALOMID. 7.7 Concomitant Therapies that may Increase the Risk of Thromboembolism Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolism, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving THALOMID with dexamethasone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to THALOMID during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to THALOMID. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to THALOMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436. Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , human and animal data (see Data ) , THALOMID can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4.1) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . THALOMID is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Even a single dose taken by a pregnant woman can cause birth defects. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Report any suspected fetal exposure to THALOMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436. Thalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant hamsters (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data A pre- and postnatal reproductive toxicity study was conducted in pregnant female rabbits. Compound-related increased abortion incidences and elevated fetotoxicity were observed at the lowest oral dose level of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5-fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA) and all higher dose levels. Neonatal mortality was elevated at oral dose levels to the lactating female rabbits \u2265150 mg/kg/day (approximately 7.5-fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA). No delay in postnatal development, including learning and memory functions, were noted at the oral dose level to the lactating female rabbits of 150 mg/kg/day (average thalidomide concentrations in milk ranged from 22 to 36 mcg per mL). In a study conducted in pregnant rabbits, thalidomide levels in fetal plasma were approximately 11% to 73% of the maternal C max . In a study conducted with 14 C-thalidomide (150 mg/kg orally) in pregnant hamsters, radioactivity was detected in the embryo, and the relative concentrations of radioactivity in the embryo and maternal plasma were about the same at 4, 12 and 24 hours after dosing. Based on the radioactivity data, thalidomide crossed the placental barrier, and the fetal levels of drug-related material were approximately similar to those of maternal levels. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thalidomide in human milk, the effects of THALOMID on the breastfed child, or the effects of THALOMID on milk production. Thalidomide is excreted in the milk of lactating rabbits (see Data ) . Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from THALOMID, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with THALOMID. Data Animal Data In lactating female rabbits at an oral dose of 150 mg/kg/day, the average thalidomide concentrations in milk ranged from 22 to 36 mcg per mL. In the study of lactating female rabbits, high concentrations of thalidomide (7741 \u2013 71425 ng per mL) were noted in milk during four weeks of pre-weaning period. Milk concentrations were 1.16 - 2.11, 1.05 \u2013 2.43, and 0.64 \u2013 3.63 times that of plasma at 30, 150 and 500 mg/kg thalidomide doses, respectively; thalidomide, as a lipophilic compound, distributed into milk, with concentrations attained similar to or slightly higher than those of systemic concentrations. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing THALOMID can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating THALOMID therapy and during therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy, while taking THALOMID, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating THALOMID. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID. Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. THALOMID treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation. Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously: one highly effective form of contraception \u2013 tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings, or implants), or partner's vasectomy, and 1 additional effective contraceptive method \u2013 male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Thalidomide is present in the semen of males who take THALOMID. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID, during dose interruptions and for up to 28 days after discontinuing THALOMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm. Infertility Based on findings in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with THALOMID [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use One hundred and seventy-six (52%) of 336 patients treated with THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone were \u226565 of age while 50 (15%) were \u226575. Patients \u226565 years of age on Study 2 had higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, constipation, fatigue, nausea, hypokalemia, deep venous thrombosis, hyperglycemia, pulmonary embolism, and asthenia compared to patients <65."

      "11 DESCRIPTION THALOMID, \u03b1-(N-phthalimido) glutarimide, is an immunomodulatory agent. The empirical formula for thalidomide is C 13 H 10 N 2 O 4 and the gram molecular weight is 258.2. The CAS number of thalidomide is 50-35-1. Chemical Structure of Thalidomide Note: \u2219 = asymmetric carbon atom Thalidomide is an off-white to white, odorless, crystalline powder that is soluble at 25\u00b0C in dimethyl sulfoxide and sparingly soluble in water and ethanol. The glutarimide moiety contains a single asymmetric center and, therefore, may exist in either of two optically active forms designated S-(-) or R-(+). THALOMID is an equal mixture of the S-(-) and R-(+) forms and, therefore, has a net optical rotation of zero. THALOMID is available in 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg capsules for oral administration. Active ingredient: thalidomide. Inactive ingredients: pregelatinized starch and magnesium stearate. The 50 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, and black ink. The 100 mg capsule shell contains black iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, titanium dioxide, gelatin, and black ink. The 150 mg capsule shell contains FD&C blue #2, black iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, titanium dioxide, gelatin, and black and white ink. The 200 mg capsule shell contains FD&C blue #2, titanium dioxide, gelatin, and white ink. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of THALOMID is not fully understood. Cellular activities of thalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex. THALOMID possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL); however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-\u03b1 levels in HIV-seropositive patients. Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma (T cell-derived cytokines associated with cytotoxic activity). Thalidomide was found to inhibit angiogenesis in a human umbilical artery explant model in vitro . The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absorption of THALOMID is slow after oral administration. The maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 2-5 hours after administration. The absolute bioavailability of thalidomide from thalidomide capsules has not yet been characterized in human subjects due to its poor aqueous solubility. Based on the 14 C-radiolabel thalidomide study in human, greater than 90% of the total radioactivity is recovered in urine suggesting good oral absorption. While the extent of absorption (as measured by area under the curve [AUC]) is proportional to dose in healthy subjects, the observed peak concentration (C max ) increased in a less than proportional manner (see Table 5 below). This lack of C max dose proportionality, coupled with the observed increase in T max values, suggests that the poor solubility of thalidomide in aqueous media may be hindering the rate of absorption. Table 5: Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values for THALOMID Mean (%CV) Population/ Single Dose AUC 0-\u221e mcg\u2219hr/mL C max mcg/mL T max (hrs) Half-life (hrs) Healthy Subjects (n=14) 50 mg 4.9 (16%) 0.62 (52%) 2.9 (66%) 5.52 (37%) 200 mg 18.9 (17%) 1.76 (30%) 3.5 (57%) 5.53 (25%) 400 mg 36.4 (26%) 2.82 (28%) 4.3 (37%) 7.29 (36%) Patients with Hansen's Disease (n=6) 400 mg 46.4 (44.1%) 3.44 (52.6%) 5.7 (27%) 6.86 (17%) Coadministration of THALOMID (thalidomide) with a high-fat meal causes minor (<10%) changes in the observed AUC and C max values; however, it causes an increase in T max to approximately 6 hours. Distribution In human plasma, the geometric mean plasma protein binding was 55% and 66%, respectively, for (+)-(R)- and (-)-(S)-thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of thalidomide in HIV-seropositive adult male subjects receiving thalidomide 100 mg/day, thalidomide was detectable in the semen. Metabolism In a 14 C-radiolabel ADME study in humans, unchanged drug is the predominant circulating component. Thalidomide is not a substrate of the cytochrome P450 system. At therapeutic concentrations, thalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro . Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not anticipated. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg and 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours. Following a single 400 mg oral dose of radiolabeled thalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6% of the administered dose by Day 8. The majority of the radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hours following dose administration. In humans, 14 C-thalidomide is primarily excreted in urine (91.9% of the radioactive dose) mainly as hydrolytic metabolites while fecal excretion is minor (<2% of the dose). Unchanged thalidomide is not eliminated by the kidney to a notable degree (<3.5% of the dose). Effects of Weight There is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance. In MM patients with body weight from 47-133 kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from approximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0.605 L/h per 10 kg body weight increase. Effects of Age, Gender and Race Analysis of the data from pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Hansen's disease ranging in age from 20 to 69 years does not reveal any age-related changes. While a comparative trial of the effects of gender on thalidomide pharmacokinetics has not been conducted, examination of the data for thalidomide does not reveal any significant gender differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Pharmacokinetic Data in Special Populations HIV-seropositive Subjects: There is no apparent significant difference in measured pharmacokinetic parameter values between healthy human subjects and HIV-seropositive subjects following single-dose administration of THALOMID Capsules. Patients with Hansen's Disease: Analysis of data from a small study in Hansen's patients suggests that these patients, relative to healthy subjects, may have an increased bioavailability of THALOMID. The increase is reflected both in an increased area under the curve and in increased peak plasma levels. The clinical significance of this increase is unknown. Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic data are available in subjects below the age of 18 years. Patients with Renal Impairment: Renal impairment is not expected to influence drug exposure since <3.5% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Multiple Myeloma (MM) The efficacy and safety of THALOMID in patients with multiple myeloma were evaluated in two randomized, multi-center studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Study 1 was an open-label study which randomized 207 symptomatic patients with newly diagnosed MM to THALOMID plus dexamethasone (N = 103) versus dexamethasone alone (N=104). The THALOMID dose was 200 mg daily and the dexamethasone dose was 40 mg orally once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 28-days. Each group was treated for four 28-day cycles. Study 2 randomized 470 newly diagnosed patients with MM to THALOMID plus dexamethasone (N=235) versus placebo plus dexamethasone (N=235). In the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm, a starting dose of thalidomide 50 mg was escalated to 200 mg/day (cycle 2) once daily for 28 days. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone once daily given on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 (every 28 days). Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each cycle. Treatment continued as tolerated until disease progression. Baseline demographics for both studies are presented in Table 6 and disease characteristics for the study population are summarized in Tables 7 (Study 1) and 8 (Study 2).

Response rates based on serum or urine paraprotein measurements were significantly higher in the combination arm (52% vs. 36%). The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 2 was time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression, based on the myeloma response criteria. A preplanned interim analysis for Study 2 demonstrated that the combination of THALOMID plus dexamethasone was superior to placebo plus dexamethasone with respect to TTP (Table 9).

Two double-blind, randomized, controlled trials reported the dermatologic response to a 7-day course of 100 mg thalidomide (four times daily) or control. Dosage was lower for patients under 50 kg in weight.

All patients also received dapsone. The primary endpoint was reduction in weekly steroid dosage.

A subset of patients with ENL controlled on thalidomide demonstrated repeated relapse upon drug withdrawal and remission with reinstitution of therapy. Twenty U.S. patients between the ages of 11 and 17 years were treated with thalidomide, generally at 100 mg daily. Response rates and safety profiles were similar to that observed in the adult population. Thirty-two other published studies containing over 1600 patients consistently report generally successful treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL with thalidomide."
