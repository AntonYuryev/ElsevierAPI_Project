    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O- demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin is a white to yellowish-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but is freely soluble in methanol and soluble in 95% ethanol. Ivermectin tablets are available as 3-mg tablets containing the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and pregelatinized starch.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 to 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 to 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Stongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate* (%) Ivermectin \u2020 Comparative Agent Albendazole \u2021 Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole \u00a7 Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) *Number and % of evaluable patients \u2020170-200 mcg/kg \u2021200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days \u00a725 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of greater than 90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Onchocerciasis Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. Neurotoxicity with the use of ivermectin, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death, has been reported in patients without onchocerciasis or in patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of Loa loa infection. These reactions have generally resolved with supportive care and the discontinuation of ivermectin."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful post-treatment follow-up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Strongyloidiasis The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin does not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required. Drug Interactions Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was co-administered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m2/day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Strongyloidiasis In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to ivermectin: Body as a Whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). In comparative trials, patients treated with ivermectin experienced more abdominal distention and chest discomfort than patients treated with albendazole. However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%) (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2% (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u2265 1% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug-related headache and myalgia occurred in < 1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u2265 1% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin."

      "OVERDOSAGE Cases of neurotoxicity, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death have been reported with recommended dosage and overdosage of ivermectin (see WARNINGS ). Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after single oral doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg and 40 to 50 mg/kg, respectively. No significant lethality was observed in dogs after single oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg. At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis. In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis. In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present. Induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage as soon as possible, followed by purgatives and other routine anti-poison measures, may be indicated if needed to prevent absorption of ingested material."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O- demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin is a white to yellowish-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but is freely soluble in methanol and soluble in 95% ethanol. Ivermectin tablets are available as 3-mg tablets containing the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and pregelatinized starch.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin tablets in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 - 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 - 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Stongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin tablets administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate* (%) Ivermectin \u2020 Comparative Agent Albendazole \u2021 Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole \u00a7 Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) *Number and % of evaluable patients \u2020170-200 mcg/kg \u2021200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days \u00a725 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of >90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin tablets in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 - 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 - 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1."

    "microbiology": [
      "Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages."

      "Clinical Studies Stongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days).

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Onchocerciasis Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. Neurotoxicity with the use of ivermectin, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death, has been reported in patients without onchocerciasis or in patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of Loa loa infection. These reactions have generally resolved with supportive care and the discontinuation of ivermectin."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful post-treatment follow-up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Strongyloidiasis The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin does not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required. Drug Interactions Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was co-administered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m2/day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%) (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6-20 and lactation days 2-20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 - 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69-75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.

No drug-related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg/kg/day (1959 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No drug-related tumors were noted in males at doses \u2264 3 mg/kg/day (599 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1, 1 and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses \u2264 1 mg/kg/day (68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA= 4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12. Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies, see Figures 1 through 4.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6-20 and lactation days 2-20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 - 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69-75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.

In a 2-year oral rat carcinogenicity study, ivermectin was administered to Wistar rats at gavage doses of 1, 3, and 9 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was noted in males treated with 9 mg/kg/day (1766 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) ivermectin. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. No drug-related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg/kg/day (1959 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No drug-related tumors were noted in males at doses \u2264 3 mg/kg/day (599 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1, 1 and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses \u2264 1 mg/kg/day (68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA= 4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12. Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies, see Figures 1 through 4.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including Ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of Ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6-20 and lactation days 2-20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of Ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 - 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69-75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.

Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1, 1 and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses \u2264 1 mg/kg/day (68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either Ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA= 4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12. Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies, see Figures 1 through 4.

      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin USP is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin USP is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin USP is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O -demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23- dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin USP is a white to yellowish-white crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H2B1a) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 to 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 to 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Strongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate Number and % of evaluable patients (%) Ivermectin 170-200 mcg/kg Comparative Agent Albendazole 200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of greater than 90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Onchocerciasis Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae- producing adult parasites."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ivermectin tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. Neurotoxicity with the use of ivermectin, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death, has been reported in patients without onchocerciasis or in patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of Loa loa infection. These reactions have generally resolved with supportive care and the discontinuation of ivermectin."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful post-treatment follow-up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Strongyloidiasis: The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis: The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin does not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required."

      "DRUG INTERACTIONS Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was co-administered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m2/day basis). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well- controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Strongyloidiasis In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to ivermectin: Body as a Whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). In comparative trials, patients treated with ivermectin experienced more abdominal distention and chest discomfort than patients treated with albendazole. However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%). (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2%. (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug- related headache and myalgia occurred in <1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin. Neurotoxicity including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation, and death (see WARNINGS ).

      "OVERDOSAGE Cases of neurotoxicity, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death have been reported with recommended dosage and overdosage of ivermectin (see WARNINGS ). Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after single oral doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg and 40 to 50 mg/kg, respectively. No significant lethality was observed in dogs after single oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg. At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis. In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis. In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present. Induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage as soon as possible, followed by purgatives and other routine anti-poison measures, may be indicated if needed to prevent absorption of ingested material."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations were based on AUC comparisons. The maximum topical human dose (MTHD) of ivermectin cream is 1 g applied once daily. Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre-and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectinwere administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6-20 and lactation days 2-20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1,371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic derivative isolated from the fermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis that belongs to the avermectin family of macrocyclic lactones. Ivermectin is a mixture containing not less than 95.0 % and not more than 102.0 % of 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a plus 5-O-demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-25-(1-methylethyl)-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively; and the ratio (calculated by area percentage) of component H 2 B 1a /(H 2 B 1a + H 2 B 1b )) is not less than 90.0 %. The respective empirical formulas of H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07 respectively. The structural formulas are: Component H 2 B 1a : R = C 2 H 5 , Component H 2 B 1b : R = CH 3 . Ivermectin cream contains the following inactive ingredients: carbomer copolymer type B, cetyl alcohol, citric acid monohydrate, cocodiethanolamide, dimethicone, dimethyl isosorbide, edetate disodium, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, purified water, sodium hydroxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, and stearyl alcohol.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ivermectin cream in treating rosacea lesions is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At therapeutic doses, ivermectin cream is not expected to prolong QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absorption of ivermectin from ivermectin cream was evaluated in a clinical trial in 15 adult male and female subjects with severe papulopustular rosacea applying 1 g ivermectin cream, 1% once daily. At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation) plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 hours \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 ng/mL \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 ng/mL to 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 ng.hr/mL \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69 ng.hr/mL to 75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52 week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11 or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4. Excretion The apparent terminal half-life averaged 6.5 days (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 155 hours \u00b1 40 hours, range 92 hours to 238 hours) in patients receiving a once daily cutaneous application of ivermectin cream for 28 days."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2 year dermal mouse carcinogenicity study, ivermectin was administered to CD-1 mice at topical doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day (0.1%, 0.3% and 1% ivermectin cream applied at 2 ml/kg/day). No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 10 mg/kg/day (747 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). In a 2 year oral rat carcinogenicity study, ivermectin was administered to Wistar rats at gavage doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day and 9 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was noted in males treated with 9 mg/kg/day (1766 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) ivermectin. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. No drug-related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg/kg/day (1959 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No drug-related tumors were noted in males at doses \u2264 3 mg/kg/day (599 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses \u2264 1 mg/kg/day (68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1,371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA= 4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \"clear\" and \"almost clear\") and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12. Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies, see Figures 1 through 4.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6-20 and lactation days 2-20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 - 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69-75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.

The trials were conducted in 1371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA= 4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12.

During clinical trials, 2,047 subjects with inflammatory lesions of rosacea received ivermectin cream once daily. A total of 1,555 subjects were treated once daily for more than 12 weeks, and 519 for approximately one year. Adverse reactions, reported in less than or equal to 1% of subjects treated with ivermectin cream for at least 3 months in vehicle-controlled clinical trials, included skin burning sensation and skin irritation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Ivermectin cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations were based on AUC comparisons. The maximum topical human dose (MTHD) of ivermectin cream is 1 g applied once daily. Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day, 4 mg/kg/day, and 12 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6 to 17) to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day (1909X MTHD). Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909X MTHD) group. No treatment related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708X MTHD). Oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, 1.5 mg/kg/day, 2.5 mg/kg/day, 3.5 mg/kg/day, and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis (gestational days 7 to 20) to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/kg/day (72X MTHD). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354X MTHD) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146X MTHD). No treatment related effects on embryofetal toxicity were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72X MTHD) and no treatment related effects on teratogenicity were noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146X MTHD). A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6 to 20 and lactation days 2 to 20. Neonatal death occurred at doses greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Following oral administration, ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Excretion in human milk following topical administration has not been evaluated. In oral studies in rats, ivermectin was excreted in the milk of nursing mothers and neonatal toxicity was observed in the litters. The blood-brain barrier in neonatal rats may not be fully developed at birth. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ivermectin cream in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1,371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation) plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 to 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69 to 75.16 ng\u2022hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4. Excretion The apparent terminal half-life averaged 6.5 days (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 155\u00b1 40 hours, range 92 to 238 hours) in patients receiving a once daily cutaneous application of ivermectin cream for 28 days."

In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4. Excretion The apparent terminal half-life averaged 6.5 days (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 155\u00b1 40 hours, range 92 to 238 hours) in patients receiving a once daily cutaneous application of ivermectin cream for 28 days."

No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 10 mg/kg/day (747X maximum topical human dose (MTHD)). In a 2-year oral rat carcinogenicity study, ivermectin was administered to Wistar rats at gavage doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day, and 9 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was noted in males treated with 9 mg/kg/day (1766X MTHD) ivermectin. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. No drug-related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg/kg/day (1959X MTHD). No drug-related tumors were noted in males at doses less than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (599X MTHD). Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027X MTHD).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1,371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA=4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O- demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin is a white to yellowish-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but is freely soluble in methanol and soluble in 95% ethanol. Ivermectin tablets are available as 3-mg tablets containing the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and pregelatinized starch.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin tablets in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 - 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 - 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Stongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin tablets administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate* (%) Ivermectin \u2020 Comparative Agent Albendazole \u2021 Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole \u00a7 Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) *Number and % of evaluable patients \u2020170-200 mcg/kg \u2021200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days \u00a725 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of >90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate* (%) Ivermectin \u2020 Comparative Agent Albendazole \u2021 Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole \u00a7 Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) *Number and % of evaluable patients \u2020170-200 mcg/kg \u2021200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days \u00a725 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of >90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Onchocerciasis Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ivermectin tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. Neurotoxicity with the use of ivermectin, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death, has been reported in patients without onchocerciasis or in patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of Loa loa infection. These reactions have generally resolved with supportive care and the discontinuation of ivermectin."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful post-treatment follow-up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Strongyloidiasis The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin does not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required. Drug Interactions Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was co-administered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m2/day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Strongyloidiasis In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to ivermectin: Body as a Whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). In comparative trials, patients treated with ivermectin experienced more abdominal distention and chest discomfort than patients treated with albendazole. However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%) (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2% (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u2265 1% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug-related headache and myalgia occurred in < 1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u2265 1% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin.

Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after single oral doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg and 40 to 50 mg/kg, respectively. No significant lethality was observed in dogs after single oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg. At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis. In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis. In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O- demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin is a white to yellowish-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but is freely soluble in methanol and soluble in 95% ethanol. Ivermectin tablets are available as 3-mg tablets containing the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and pregelatinized starch.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b121.9) (range: 16.4 to 101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b115.6) (range: 13.9 to 68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Stongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate Number and % of evaluable patients (%) Ivermectin 170 to 200 mcg/kg Comparative Agent Albendazole 200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of >90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17 to 41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Onchocerciasis Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful posttreatment follow-up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Strongyloidiasis The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin does not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required. Drug Interactions Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was coadministered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis ). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%) (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2% (See WARNINGS ). In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug-related headache and myalgia occurred in <1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after single oral doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg and 40 to 50 mg/kg, respectively. No significant lethality was observed in dogs after single oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg. At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis. In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis. In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present. Induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage as soon as possible, followed by purgatives and other routine anti-poison measures, may be indicated if needed to prevent absorption of ingested material."

      "Ivermectin Lotion, 0.5% Lice Treatment Lotion THE FACTS OF LICE Please read all information before using Ivermectin Lotion. If you or a member of your household has head lice, don't panic. Keep calm. Anyone can get head lice \u2013 it has nothing to do with cleanliness or poor hygiene. Head lice are treatable and very rarely cause serious health problems. What are head lice? Head lice are small insects that live and feed on the human scalp. They may get as big as sesame seeds and are brown. Lice do not fly or jump from one person to another. They can only crawl. What are nits? Nits are lice eggs laid on the hair near the scalp. One louse may lay over 100 nits. Nits are oval shaped, tiny and greyish-white. They are attached to hair with a waterproof glue-like substance that cannot be washed out or blown away. How do head lice spread? Head lice spread easily from close head-to-head or hand-to-head contact with persons who have lice. They may also be spread by sharing hats, helmets, scarves, headphones, brushes, combs, bedding and clothing. How do you know if you have lice? Itching is the most common symptom. Scratching behind the ears or the back of the neck is a sign that you should check for head lice. Scabs or blood spots may be seen. How do you prevent the spread of lice? Avoid direct head-to-head contact with anyone known to have live, crawling lice. Do not share combs, brushes, hats, scarves, bandannas, ribbons, barrettes, hair bands, towels, helmets, or other hair-related personal items with anyone else, whether they have lice or not. Avoid sleepovers and slumber parties during lice outbreaks. Lice can live in bedding, pillows, and carpets that have recently been used by someone with lice. How do I use Ivermectin Lotion? Important: Read warnings before use Children 6 months of age to under 12 years of age: an adult should supervise use Adults and children 6 months of age and over: Inspect All household members should be checked by another person for lice and/or nits (eggs). Use a magnifying glass in bright light to help you see the lice and/or nits (eggs). Use a tool, such as a comb or two unsharpened pencils to lift and part the hair. Look for tiny nits near the scalp, beginning at the back of the neck and behind the ears. Examine small sections of the hair (1-2 inches wide) at a time. Unlike dandruff, nits stick to the hair. Dandruff should move when lightly touched. If either lice or nits (eggs) are found, treat with product. Treat Your hair and scalp must be DRY before applying product. Figure A Use the top of cap to break the tamper seal on the tube (see Figure A ). Apply product directly to dry hair and scalp (see Figure B ). Completely cover your scalp and hair closest to the scalp first, and then apply outwards towards the ends of your hair (see Figure C ). Use only amount needed to completely cover hair and scalp, up to 1 entire tube, and discard the remaining. Rub product throughout your hair (see Figure D ). Figure B Figure C Figure D It is important to completely cover your entire head so that all lice and eggs are exposed to the lotion. Be sure that each hair is coated from the scalp to the tip. Wait and rinse Allow product to stay on your hair and scalp for 10 minutes after it has been applied. Use a timer or clock. Start timing after you have completely covered your hair and scalp with product (see Figure E ). After 10 minutes, rinse product completely from your hair and scalp using only water (see Figure F ). Figure E Figure F After rinsing, dry and style as usual. Wait 24 hours before applying shampoo. After treatment Wash your hands after applying product. Nit combing is not necessary when treating with product for it to work, but if desired, a fine-tooth comb or special nit comb may be used to remove dead lice and nits. This is a single use product. Discard tube after use. Do not use again on the same person and same lice infestation without talking to a healthcare provider first. If infestation continues, see a doctor for other treatments. Machine wash any bedding and clothing used by anyone having lice. Machine wash at high temperatures (150\u00b0F) and tumble in a hot dryer for 20 minutes. After finishing treatment with lice medicine, check everyone in your family for lice after one week. Consider treatment for those who have lice. WARNINGS For external use only. Use only on the scalp. Do not use On children under 6 months of age Near the eyes Inside the nose, ear, mouth, or vagina On lice in eyebrows or eyelashes. See a doctor if lice are present in these areas.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data on the use of ivermectin, including ivermectin cream, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 1909 or 354 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. These orally administered doses were maternally toxic to pregnant rats and rabbits. In a pre-and postnatal developmental study in rats, neonatal toxicity and adverse effects on behavioral development were observed when ivermectin was orally administered to pregnant females during gestation and lactation ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled trials of ivermectin cream have been conducted in pregnant women. Retrospective observational studies evaluated pregnancy outcomes in over 700 women in various stages of pregnancy who received oral ivermectin for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in rural Africa. In an additional, randomized open-label trial, 397 pregnant women in their second trimester received a single dose of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths. When compared with a pregnant, untreated population, no differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between the treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester. Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 1.5, 4, and 12 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death occurred at 12 mg/kg/day [1909 times the MRHD based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison]. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 12 mg/kg/day (1909 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 4 mg/kg/day (708 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Oral doses of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal death occurred at doses \u2265 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Carpal flexure occurred in the fetuses from the 4.5 mg/kg/day (354 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) group. Fetal weight decrease was noted at 3.5 mg/kg/day (146 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No treatment related embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 2.5 mg/kg/day (72 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to pregnant female rats during gestational days 6 to 20 and lactation days 2 to 20. Neonatal death occurred at doses \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. Behavior development of newborn rats was adversely affected at all doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The presence of ivermectin in human milk following topical administration of ivermectin has not been evaluated. There are no data available regarding the effects of ivermectin on milk production. Published literature suggests that ivermectin was detectable in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this report to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ivermectin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ivermectin cream or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ivermectin cream in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1,371 subjects in the two pivotal clinical studies of ivermectin cream, 170 (12.4%) were 65 and over, while 37 (2.7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean \u00b1 standard deviation) plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (T max ) at 10 \u00b1 8 hours post-dose, the maximum concentration (C max ) was 2.10 \u00b1 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 to 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC 0-24hr ) was 36.14 \u00b1 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69 to 75.16 ng\u2022hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period. Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed. Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.

No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 10 mg/kg/day (747 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). In a 2-year oral rat carcinogenicity study, ivermectin was administered to Wistar rats at gavage doses of 1, 3, and 9 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was noted in males treated with 9 mg/kg/day (1766 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) ivermectin. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. No drug-related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg/kg/day (1959 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No drug-related tumors were noted in males at doses \u2264 3 mg/kg/day (599 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (the Ames test and the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (rat micronucleus assay). In a fertility study, oral doses of 0.1, 1, and 9 mg/kg/day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats. Mortality occurred at 9 mg/kg/day (1027 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses \u2264 1 mg/kg/day (68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The trials were conducted in 1,371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream. Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA=3) and 21% scored as severe (IGA=4) at baseline. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome (percentage of subjects \u201cclear\u201d and \u201calmost clear\u201d) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Table 1 presents the co-primary efficacy results at Week 12. Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies, see Figures 1 through 4.

      "DESCRIPTION Ivermectin tablet is a semisynthetic, anthelmintic agent for oral administration. Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a class of highly active broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5- O -demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A 1a and less than 10% 5- O demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A 1a , generally referred to as 22,23- dihydroavermectin B 1a and B 1b , or H 2 B 1a and H 2 B 1b , respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C 48 H 74 O 14 and C 47 H 72 O 14 , with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are: Ivermectin is a white to yellowish-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder with a melting point of about 155\u00b0C. It is insoluble in water but is freely soluble in methanol and soluble in 95% ethanol. Ivermectin tablets are available in 3 mg and 6 mg tablets containing the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, pregelatinized starch, magnesium stearate. image description"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of ivermectin, plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose. In two studies, after single 12-mg doses of ivermectin tablets in fasting healthy volunteers (representing a mean dose of 165 mcg/kg), the mean peak plasma concentrations of the major component (H 2 B 1a ) were 46.6 (\u00b1 21.9) (range: 16.4-101.1) and 30.6 (\u00b1 15.6) (range: 13.9-68.4) ng/mL, respectively, at approximately 4 hours after dosing. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of ivermectin in man is approximately 18 hours following oral administration. The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ivermectin were further assessed in a multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral doses of 30 to 120 mg (333 to 2000 mcg/kg) ivermectin in a fasted state or 30 mg (333 to 600 mcg/kg) ivermectin following a standard high-fat (48.6 g of fat) meal. Administration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of 30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. Microbiology Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate- gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the facts that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels and that the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels. In addition, ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. Ivermectin is active against various life-cycle stages of many but not all nematodes. It is active against the tissue microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus but not against the adult form. Its activity against Strongyloides stercoralis is limited to the intestinal stages. Clinical Studies Strongyloidiasis Two controlled clinical studies using albendazole as the comparative agent were carried out in international sites where albendazole is approved for the treatment of strongyloidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract, and three controlled studies were carried out in the U.S. and internationally using thiabendazole as the comparative agent. Efficacy, as measured by cure rate, was defined as the absence of larvae in at least two follow-up stool examinations 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Based on this criterion, efficacy was significantly greater for ivermectin tablets (a single dose of 170 to 200 mcg/kg) than for albendazole (200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days). Ivermectin tablets administered as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg for 1 day was as efficacious as thiabendazole administered at 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days. Summary of Cure Rates for Ivermectin Versus Comparative Agents in the Treatment of Strongyloidiasis Cure Rate*(%) Ivermectin ** Comparative Agent Albendazole *** Comparative International Study 24/26 (92) 12/22 (55) WHO Study 126/152 (83) 67/149 (45) Thiabendazole \u2020 Comparative International Study 9/14 (64) 13/15 (87) US Studies 14/14 (100) 16/17 (94) * Number and % of evaluable patients ** 170-200 mcg/kg *** 200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days \u2020 25 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 days In one study conducted in France, a non-endemic area where there was no possibility of reinfection, several patients were observed to have recrudescence of Strongyloides larvae in their stool as long as 106 days following ivermectin therapy. Therefore, at least three stool examinations should be conducted over the three months following treatment to ensure eradication. If recrudescence of larvae is observed, retreatment with ivermectin is indicated. Concentration techniques (such as using a Baermann apparatus) should be employed when performing these stool examinations, as the number of Strongyloides larvae per gram of feces may be very low. Onchocerciasis The evaluation of ivermectin tablets in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on the results of clinical studies involving 1278 patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving adult patients with moderate to severe onchocercal infection, patients who received a single dose of 150 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets experienced an 83.2% and 99.5% decrease in skin microfilariae count (geometric mean) 3 days and 3 months after the dose, respectively. A marked reduction of >90% was maintained for up to 12 months after the single dose. As with other microfilaricidal drugs, there was an increase in the microfilariae count in the anterior chamber of the eye at day 3 after treatment in some patients. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with ivermectin tablets had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo. In a separate open study involving pediatric patients ages 6 to 13 (n=103; weight range: 17-41 kg), similar decreases in skin microfilariae counts were observed for up to 12 months after dosing."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ivermectin tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract Ivermectin tablet is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis . This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of ivermectin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Clinical Studies .) Onchocerciasis. Ivermectin tablet is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus . This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C). NOTE: Ivermectin tablet has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites. The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules (nodulectomy) may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ivermectin tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with ivermectin tablets for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS , Onchocerciasis .) The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/ or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. Neurotoxicity with the use of ivermectin, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death, has been reported in patients without onchocerciasis or in patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of Loa loa infection. These reactions have generally resolved with supportive care and the discontinuation of ivermectin."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: pain (including neck and back pain), red eye, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, seizures, or coma. This syndrome has been seen very rarely following the use of ivermectin. In individuals who warrant treatment with ivermectin for any reason and have had significant exposure to Loa loa -endemic areas of West or Central Africa, pretreatment assessment for loiasis and careful post-treatment follow- up should be implemented. Information for Patients Ivermectin tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with water. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics .) Strongyloidiasis: The patient should be reminded of the need for repeated stool examinations to document clearance of infection with Strongyloides stercoralis . Onchocerciasis: The patient should be reminded that treatment with ivermectin tablets do not kill the adult Onchocerca parasites, and therefore repeated follow-up and retreatment is usually required. Drug Interactions Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when ivermectin was co-administered with warfarin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ivermectin. Ivermectin was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames microbial mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and without rat liver enzyme activation, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell Line L5178Y (cytotoxicity and mutagenicity) assays, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts. Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m 2 /day basis). Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established. Nursing Mothers Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast-feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ivermectin tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, treatment of an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Strongyloidiasis in Immunocompromised Hosts In immunocompromised (including HIV-infected) patients being treated for intestinal strongyloidiasis, repeated courses of therapy may be required. Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in such patients to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Several treatments, i.e., at 2-week intervals, may be required, and cure may not be achievable. Control of extra- intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i.e., once per month, may be helpful."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Strongyloidiasis In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin tablets, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to ivermectin tablets: Body as a Whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). In comparative trials, patients treated with ivermectin tablets experienced more abdominal distention and chest discomfort than patients treated with albendazole. However, ivermectin tablet was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin tablets. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS , Onchocerciasis .) Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%). (See WARNINGS .) In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2%. (See WARNINGS .) In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin tablets, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug-related headache and myalgia occurred in <1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin tablets: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in \u22651% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin. Neurotoxicity including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation, and death (see WARNINGS ).

      "OVERDOSAGE Cases of neurotoxicity, including alteration of consciousness of variable severity (e.g., somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, and coma), confusion, disorientation and death have been reported with recommended dosage and overdosage of ivermectin (see WARNINGS ). Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after single oral doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg and 40 to 50 mg/kg, respectively. No significant lethality was observed in dogs after single oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg. At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis. In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis. In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present. Induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage as soon as possible, followed by purgatives and other routine anti-poison measures, may be indicated if needed to prevent absorption of ingested material."
