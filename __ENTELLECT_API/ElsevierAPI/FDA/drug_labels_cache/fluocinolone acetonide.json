    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use ) . If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 ."

Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7 \u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil.

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF.

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing\u2019s syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (SEE PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. A post marketing (open-label) safety study was conducted in 58 children to evaluate the local safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% when applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face in children (2 to 12 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (see Table of Incidence of Adverse Events).

      "DESCRIPTION Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (scalp oil) contains fluocinolone acetonide {(6\u03b1, 11\u03b2, 16\u03b1)-6,9-difluoro-11,21-dihydroxy-16,17[(1-methylethylidene)bis(oxy)]-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, cyclic 16,17 acetal with acetone}, a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. This formulation is also marketed as fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (body oil) for use as body oil for atopic dermatitis in adults and for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients 2 years and older, and as fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) for chronic eczematous external otitis. Chemically, fluocinolone acetonide is C 24 H 30 F 2 O 6 . It has the following structural formula: Fluocinolone acetonide has a molecular weight of 452.50. It is a white crystalline powder that is odorless, stable in light, and melts at 270\u00b0C with decomposition; soluble in alcohol, acetone and methanol; slightly soluble in chloroform; insoluble in water. Each gram of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (scalp oil) contains approximately 0.11 mg of fluocinolone acetonide in a blend of oils, which contain isopropyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, oleth-2 and refined peanut oil NF. Each packaged product contains 2 shower caps. The shower cap is made of low density polyethylene material with rubber elastic."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES In a vehicle-controlled study for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp in adults, after 21 days of treatment, 60% of patients on active treatment and 21% of patients on the drug vehicle had excellent to cleared clinical response. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre- stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 ug/dL; normal: cortisol > 7 ug/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 ug/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0 F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 4. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. 5. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. 6. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area. Application to intertriginous areas should be avoided due to the increased possibility of local adverse events such as striae, atrophy, and telangiectasia, which may be irreversible. The smallest amount of drug needed to cover the affected areas should be applied. Long term safety in the pediatric population has not been established. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [ See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [ See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil for peanut-sensitive individuals. [ See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects' responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [ See Description (11) ] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Efficacy in a placebo-controlled study for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis on 154 patients (adults and children 2 years of age and older) treated with five drops per ear of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily, after 7 days of treatment, showed fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% to be superior to placebo in clearing the signs and symptoms of eczematous external otitis. Clinical safety studies were conducted on the same formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil used in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Do not use occlusive dressings. 2. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 3. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 4. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 5. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 2 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with chronic eczematous external otitis. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES In a vehicle-controlled study for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp in adults, after 21 days of treatment, 60% of patients on active treatment and 21% of patients on the drug vehicle had excellent to cleared clinical response. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre- stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 ug/dL; normal: cortisol > 7 ug/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 ug/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0 F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 4. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. 5. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. 6. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area. Application to intertriginous areas should be avoided due to the increased possibility of local adverse events such as striae, atrophy, and telangiectasia, which may be irreversible. The smallest amount of drug needed to cover the affected areas should be applied. Long term safety in the pediatric population has not been established. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-in\ufb02ammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-in\ufb02ammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical ef\ufb01cacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. In\ufb02ammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity ( see PRECAUTIONS\u2014Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information For Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to bodyweight ratio. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity ( see PRECAUTIONS\u2014Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-in\ufb02ammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-in\ufb02ammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical ef\ufb01cacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. In\ufb02ammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity [see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 PEDIATRIC USE ] . If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. LABORATORY TESTS The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. PREGNANCY Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description ( 11 )] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated just below 450\u00b0F for at least 30 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [See Description ( 11 )] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES In a vehicle-controlled study for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp in adults, after 21 days of treatment, 60% of patients on active treatment and 21% of patients on the drug vehicle had excellent to cleared clinical response. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 mcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7mcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 mcg/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0 F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 4. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. 5. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. 6. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area. Application to intertriginous areas should be avoided due to the increased possibility of local adverse events such as striae, atrophy, and telangiectasia, which may be irreversible. The smallest amount of drug needed to cover the affected areas should be applied. Long term safety in the pediatric population has not been established. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (SEE PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil, in which peanut protein is not detectable at 2.5 ppm. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. 2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed. 3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. 4. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing. 5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test; ACTH stimulation test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and the absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

In hairy sites, the hair should be parted to allow direct contact with the lesion. Occlusive dressing may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. Some plastic films may be flammable and due care should be exercised in their use. Similarly, caution should be employed when such films are used on children or left in their proximity, to avoid the possibility of accidental suffocation. If an infection develops, the use of the occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between the vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolities are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of the application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. 2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed. 3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by a physician. 4. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing. 5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test; ACTH stimulation test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category C. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use ) . If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time."

      "Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman."

      "Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description ( 11 )] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated just below 450\u00b0F for at least 30 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [See Description ( 11 )] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil used in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Do not use occlusive dressings. 2. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 3. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 4. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 5. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 2 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with chronic eczematous external otitis. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. (5.1) o Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. (5.1,8.4) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ). Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. (5.2, 6.1) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. (5.3) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide oil, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil for peanut sensitive individuals [see Description (11)] . Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fluocinolone acetonide oil and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fluocinolone acetonide oil or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil for the topical treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil in pediatric patients with chronic eczematous external otitis below the age of 2 years have not been established. Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA Axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil, which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide oil is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil. Evaluation in Pediatric Patients 2 to 6 years old Use of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil in pediatric patients 2 to 6 years old is supported by open-label safety trials conducted in 33 pediatric subjects (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Subjects were treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]."

Chemically, fluocinolone acetonide is C 24 H 30 F 2 O 6 . It has the following structural formula: Fluocinolone acetonide has a molecular weight of 452.50. It is a white crystalline powder that is odorless, stable in light, and melts at 270\u00b0C with decomposition; soluble in alcohol, acetone and methanol; slightly soluble in chloroform; insoluble in water. Each gram of fluocinolone acetonide oil contains approximately 0.11 mg of fluocinolone acetonide in a blend of oils, which contains isopropyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, oleth-2 and refined peanut oil. Fluocinolone acetonide oil is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil. The bulk refined peanut oil, used in fluocinolone acetonide oil is heated between 232\u00b0C - 246\u00b0C (450\u00b0F - 475\u00b0F) for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in eczematous external otitis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Fluocinolone acetonide oil is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression HPA axis suppression was evaluated in 33 pediatric subjects 2 to 12 years old (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post- ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal cortisol >7 \u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol >18 \u00b5g/dL) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil for peanut-sensitive individuals [see Description ( 11 )] . Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 pediatric subjects 3 months to 2 years old to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil is not approved for use in pediatric patients for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding.

Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil (scalp oil) is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively."

However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression HPA axis suppression following administration of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil was not assessed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [See Description (11) ] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre- stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins.

Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre- stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS\u2014Pediatric Use ) . If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on terato\u00adgenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

Clinical safety studies were conducted on the same formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%, marketed as fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 mcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7 mcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 mcg/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical, oil 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical, oil 0.01% and histamine/saline controls on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0 F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external ear use only. Do not use occlusive dressings. 2. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 3. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 4. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 5. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops). Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops). Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops). Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) may be used twice daily for up to 2 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with chronic eczematous external otitis. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) is not recommended for use on the face (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (See PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) for peanut-sensitive individuals."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [See Description (11) ] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre- stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodi\u00adcally for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substi\u00adtute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS- Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when adminis\u00adtered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corti\u00adcosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quanti\u00adties not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimula\u00adtion. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endocrine System Adverse Reactions : Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.1) Local Adverse Reactions : Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. (5.2, 6.1) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions : May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. (5.3) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide for peanut-sensitive individuals [see Description (11)]. Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use fluocinolone acetonide on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply fluocinolone acetonide directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fluocinolone acetonide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fluocinolone acetonide or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis of the scalp. Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide, which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects' responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide."

However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression HPA axis suppression following administration of fluocinolone acetonide was not assessed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) o Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use, occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, reduce the frequency of application or discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil for peanut-sensitive individuals [see Description ( 11 )]. Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply fluocinolone acetonide topical oil directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil for the topical treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older for up to 4 weeks. Safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis below the age of 3 months have not been established. Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, which contains refined peanut oil, on pediatric subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects' responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil. Evaluation in Pediatric Patients 2 to 6 years old Use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil in pediatric patients 2 to 6 years old is supported by open-label safety trials conducted in 33 pediatric subjects (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Evaluation in Pediatric Patients 3 months to 2 years old Use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil in pediatric patients 3 months to 2 years old is supported by an open-label safety trial conducted in 29 pediatric subjects (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months, and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]."

However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression HPA axis suppression was evaluated in 29 pediatric subjects 3 months to 2 years old (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months, and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years) and 33 pediatric subjects 2 years to 12 years old (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. In subjects 3 months to 2 years old, all subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). In subjects 2 to 12 years old, 4 out of 18 subjects 2 to 5 years old showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL) at the end of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES In a vehicle-controlled study for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp in adults, after 21 days of treatment, 60% of patients on active treatment and 21% of patients on the drug vehicle had excellent to cleared clinical response. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated just below 450\u00b0 F for at least 30 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area. Application to intertriginous areas should be avoided due to the increased possibility of local adverse events such as striae, atrophy, and telangiectasia, which may be irreversible. The smallest amount of drug needed to cover the affected areas should be applied. Long term safety in the pediatric population has not been established. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-in\ufb02ammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-in\ufb02ammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical ef\ufb01cacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. In\ufb02ammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity ( see PRECAUTIONS\u2014Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information For Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to bodyweight ratio. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics : The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses, (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (See PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for the Patient: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Laboratory Tests : The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression: Urinary free cortisol test ACTH stimulation test Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Pregnancy Category C: Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio . HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) o Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops for peanut sensitive individuals [see Description ( 11 )] . Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops for the topical treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops in pediatric patients with chronic eczematous external otitis below the age of 2 years have not been established. Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA Axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops, which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops. Evaluation in Pediatric Patients 2 to 6 years old Use of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops in pediatric patients 2 to 6 years old is supported by open-label safety trials conducted in 33 pediatric subjects (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Subjects were treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops for the topical treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops in pediatric patients with chronic eczematous external otitis below the age of 2 years have not been established. Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA Axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops, which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops. Evaluation in Pediatric Patients 2 to 6 years old Use of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops in pediatric patients 2 to 6 years old is supported by open-label safety trials conducted in 33 pediatric subjects (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Subjects were treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil ear drops twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ."

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. ( 5.1 ) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. ( 5.1 ) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.4.1 Systemic Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients HPA axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk for systemic adverse reactions than are adults when treated with topical corticosteroids. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 8.4.2 Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Subjects A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. The bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated between 232\u02daC \u2013 246\u02daC (450\u02daF \u2013 475\u02daF) for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins. [See Description (11) ] 8.4.3 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 2 to 6 years old Open-label safety studies were conducted on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis. Subjects were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 15 subjects and greater than 75% in 18 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7 \u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). 8.4.4 Evaluation in Pediatric Subjects 3 months to 2 years old An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 children (7 subjects ages 3 to 6 months, 7 subjects ages > 6 to 12 months and 15 subjects ages > 12 months to 2 years of age) to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. All subjects had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with disease involvement on at least 20% body surface area. Baseline body surface area involvement was 50% to 75% in 11 subjects and greater than 75% in 7 subjects. Morning pre-stimulation and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects had normal responses to 0.125 mg of ACTH stimulation (cortisol >18 \u00b5g/dL)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids in vasoconstrictor studies."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 ) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome have been reported in patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals [see Description ( 11 )]. Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% immediately and institute appropriate therapy."

( 6.1 , 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1-844-874-7464 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying condition, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. An open-label safety study was conducted in 29 pediatric subjects 3 months to 2 years old to assess the HPA axis by ACTH stimulation testing following use of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is not approved for use in pediatric patients for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports, case series, and observational studies on fluocinolone acetonide use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Observational studies suggest maternal use of high to super-high potency topical steroids may be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight infants. Advise pregnant women to use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. Corticosteroids can cause fetal malformations in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids cause fetal malformations after dermal application in laboratory animals. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fluocinolone acetonide in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis of the scalp. Evaluation in Peanut-Sensitive Pediatric Patients A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, in patients with known peanut allergies. The trial enrolled 13 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The trial evaluated the subjects\u2019 responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil, the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls. Subjects were also treated with the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 subjects were negative to the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive subjects experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of use on the formulation of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES In a vehicle-controlled study for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp in adults, after 21 days of treatment, 60% of patients on active treatment and 21% of patients on the drug vehicle had excellent to cleared clinical response. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u03bcg/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u03bcg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u03bcg/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing refined peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls, on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is heated just below 450\u00b0 F for at least 30 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 4. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. 5. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. 6. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. Therefore, Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% should not be applied to the diaper area. Application to intertriginous areas should be avoided due to the increased possibility of local adverse events such as striae, atrophy, and telangiectasia, which may be irreversible. The smallest amount of drug needed to cover the affected areas should be applied. Long term safety in the pediatric population has not been established. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals."

      "DESCRIPTION Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) contain fluocinolone acetonide {(6\u03b1, 11\u03b2, 16\u03b1)-6,9- difluoro-11,21-dihydroxy-16,17[(1-methylethylidene)bis(oxy)]-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, cyclic 16,17 acetal with acetone}, a synthetic corticosteroid. This formulation is also marketed as fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (body oil) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% (scalp oil) for the treatment of psoriasis of scalp. Chemically, fluocinolone acetonide is C 24 H 30 F 2 O 6 . It has the following structural formula: Fluocinolone acetonide has a molecular weight of 452.50. It is a white crystalline powder that is odorless, stable in light, and melts at 270\u00b0C with decomposition; soluble in alcohol, acetone and methanol; slightly soluble in chloroform; insoluble in water. Each gram of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (ear drops) contains approximately 0.11 mg of fluocinolone acetonide in a blend of oils, which contains isopropyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, oleth-2 and refined peanut oil NF."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Efficacy in a placebo-controlled study for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis on 154 patients (adults and children 2 years of age and older) treated with five drops per ear of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily, after 7 days of treatment, showed fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% to be superior to placebo in clearing the signs and symptoms of eczematous external otitis. Clinical safety studies were conducted on the same formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable atopic dermatitis, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6 \u00b5g/dL; normal: cortisol > 7\u00b5g/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol > 18 \u00b5g/dL). A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with atopic dermatitis, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% and histamine/saline controls on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis after 5 days of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil used in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is heated at 475\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use ) Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals. Information for Patients: Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Do not use occlusive dressings. 2. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 3. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 4. Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 5. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. Laboratory Tests: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01%. Therefore, fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% may be used twice daily for up to 2 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with chronic eczematous external otitis. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is not recommended for use on the face (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% for peanut-sensitive individuals."

They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (see PRECAUTIONS ). HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% for peanut sensitive individuals."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01%. A post marketing (open-label) safety study was conducted in 58 children to evaluate the local safety of fluocinolone acetonide topical oil, 0.01% when applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face in children (2 to 12 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (see Table of Incidence of Adverse Events ).
