      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above.

Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: Migraine Renal and urinary disorders: Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablets was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Prucalopride tablets for oral use contain prucalopride succinate, a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide that is a serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist. The IUPAC name is: 4-Amino-5-chloro- N -[1-(3-methoxypropyl)piperidin-4-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-7-carboxamide monobutanedioate. The molecular formula is C 18 H 26 ClN 3 O 3 .C 4 H 6 O 4 and the molecular weight is 485.96. The structural formula is: Prucalopride succinate is a white to an off-white powder. It is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, water, N,N -dimethylformamide, N,N -dimethylacetamide and sparingly soluble in methanol. It is freely soluble in acidic aqueous media. However, the solubility decreases with increasing pH. It is freely soluble in water (16% w/v) but less soluble in basic solution. Each 1 mg film-coated tablet of prucalopride contains 1 mg of prucalopride (equivalent to 1.32 mg prucalopride succinate), and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The coating for the 1 mg tablet contains hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate. Each 2 mg film-coated tablet of prucalopride contains 2 mg of prucalopride (equivalent to 2.64 mg prucalopride succinate), and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The coating for the 2 mg tablet contains hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years.

In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period.

Instruct patients to discontinue prucalopride tablets immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or they experience emerging suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.1 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In clinical trials, suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Postmarketing cases of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new onset or worsening of depression have been reported within the first few weeks of starting prucalopride tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2 )]. A causal association between treatment with prucalopride tablets and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Monitor all patients treated with prucalopride tablets for new onset or worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members of patients to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and alert the healthcare provider. Instruct patients to discontinue prucalopride tablets immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of these symptoms."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride Tablets 2 mg Once Daily N=1,251 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablets 2 mg. % Placebo N=1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : Migraine Renal and urinary disorders : Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% Prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), headache (1% Prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% Prucalopride tablets, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% Prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride tablets group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4) ]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 PREGNANCY Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre-and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data ). There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for prucalopride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc's MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with Prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 PHARMACODYNAMICS High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, Prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0 to 24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food: Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism: Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion: Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0 to inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin: Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0 to 24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs: No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies: Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Tablets Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001,NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride tablets on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride tablets group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period.

Postmarketing cases of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new onset or worsening of depression have been reported within the first few weeks of starting prucalopride tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] . A causal association between treatment with prucalopride tablets and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Monitor all patients treated with prucalopride tablets for new onset or worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members of patients to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and alert the healthcare provider. Instruct patients to discontinue prucalopride tablets immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of these symptoms."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Somerset Therapeutics, LLC at 1- 800-417-9175 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2530 patients (1251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction PRUCALOPRIDE TABLET 2 mg Once Daily N=1251 \u2020 % Placebo N=1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 *Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride tablet and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablet 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablet 2 mg. \u01c2Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablet 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : migraine Renal and urinary disorders : pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride tablets, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double- blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride tablets group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride tablet was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablet 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablet 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablet for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablet was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4)] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose(about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for prucalopride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14)] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride tablets is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17-95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37-161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride tablets for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Tablets Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride tablets on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride tablets group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride tablets and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions * in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N=1,251 \u2020 % Pl acebo N=1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 * Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. \u2021 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: a bnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: migraine Renal and urinary disorders: pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double- blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4) ]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose(about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data). There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14)]. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose(about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose."

Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC50=22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Clinical Program S tudy Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above.

Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: migraine Renal and urinary disorders: pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablets was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3,350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS {highlight} 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Data Animal In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data). There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2 mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12 week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4 week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24 hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24 hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Prucalopride tablets for oral use contain prucalopride succinate, a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide that is a serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist. The IUPAC name is: 4-Amino-5-chloro- N -[1-(3-methoxypropyl)piperidin-4-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-7-carboxamide monobutanedioate. The molecular formula is C 18 H 26 ClN 3 O 3 .C 4 H 6 O 4 and the molecular weight is 485.96. The structural formula is: Prucalopride succinate is a white to an off-white powder. It is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, water, N,N -dimethylformamide, N,N -dimethylacetamide and sparingly soluble in methanol. It is freely soluble in acidic aqueous media. However, the solubility decreases with increasing pH. It is freely soluble in water (16% w/v) but less soluble in basic solution. Each 1 mg film-coated tablet of prucalopride contains 1 mg of prucalopride (equivalent to 1.32 mg prucalopride succinate), and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The coating for the 1 mg tablet contains hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate. Each 2 mg film-coated tablet of prucalopride contains 2 mg of prucalopride (equivalent to 2.64 mg prucalopride succinate), and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The coating for the 2 mg tablet contains hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate. structure.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT4 receptor affinity by 150 fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets do not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT4 receptor affinity by 150 fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years.

In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period.

Postmarketing cases of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new onset or worsening of depression have been reported within the first few weeks of starting prucalopride [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ]. A causal association between treatment with prucalopride and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Monitor all patients treated with prucalopride for new onset or worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members of patients to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and alert the healthcare provider.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2530 patients (1251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N=1251 \u2020 % Placebo N=1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 *Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. \u01c2 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: migraine Renal and urinary disorders: pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double- blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N=5715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4) ]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose(about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2 mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contraction s Following a single 2 mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17-95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37-161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2 mg oral dose, the mean AUC0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: \u2022 Lumpy or hard stools \u2022 Sensation of incomplete evacuation \u2022 Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1237 received prucalopride 1 or 2 mg and 1247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Appco Pharma LLC at 1-855-672-7726 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2530 patients (1251 received prucalopride tablets, 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablet once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride tablet 2 mg Once Daily N=1251 \u2020 % Placebo N=1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 *Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablets, 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablets, 2 mg. \u01c2 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablet, 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : migraine Renal and urinary disorders : pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablet, 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets, 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride tablets, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride tablets group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride tablets was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets, 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablets was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablet have not been established in pediatric patients. Prucalopride tablet was evaluated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, followed by a 36-week double-blind extension study in patients 6 months to 17 years with functional constipation. The interim analysis of the primary endpoint showed that the number of spontaneous bowel movements per week over 12 weeks was similar between the prucalopride tablet and placebo groups, indicating that the study was unlikely to demonstrate effectiveness. Therefore, the study was terminated early for futility. Adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in this study were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6. Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride tablets are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O- desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17-95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37-161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g ., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g ., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32P -postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic Cmax. Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride tablets for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Tablets Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride tablets on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride tablets group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-204-1431 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride Tablets 2 mg Once Daily N=1251 \u2020 % Placebo N=1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 * Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablets 2 mg. \u2021 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : Migraine Renal and urinary disorders : Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride tablets, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride tablets group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride tablets were compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablets were assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4)] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14)] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride tablets are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride tablets does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17-95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37-161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Pharmacology & OR Toxicology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride tablets for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Tablets Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride tablets on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride tablets group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mallinckrodt at 1-800-778-7898 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at Least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride tablets 2 mg Once Daily N=1,251\u2020 % Placebo N=1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u01c2 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 *Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablets 2 mg. \u01c2 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : Migraine Renal and urinary disorders : Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablets once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride tablets, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride tablets, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride tablets at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride tablets for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride tablets group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride tablets was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride tablets group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride tablets. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablets 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablets for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablets was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride tablets is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Avoid prucalopride tablets in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, a prucalopride tablet does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride tablets for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Tablets Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride tablets on day 1 ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride tablets group compared with 1.0 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride tablets and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 years to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions * in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N = 1,251 \u2020 % Placebo N = 1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 * Reported in \u2265 2% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. \u2021 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in < 2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : migraine Renal and urinary disorders : pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, < 1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 mg to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N = 5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N = 29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4) ] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80 mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data ) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2 mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose\u2011proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time\u2011independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 days to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 ng/mL and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 hours to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is > 90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radio-labeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92% to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O\u2011desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0% to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radio-labeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60% to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 years to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 kg to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 mL/min to \u2264 89 mL/min), 1.4\u2011fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min to \u2264 59 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 mL/min to \u2264 29 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10% to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 times and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 times and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (> 1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265 500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic Cmax. Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u2265 3 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 = 22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (> 1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265 500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment."

      "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic Cmax. Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u2265 3 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 = 22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47 years \u00b1 16 years (range 17 years to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16 years \u00b1 15 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride 1 or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 days to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 days to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 days to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1.0 days to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact SKG Pharma Inc. at 1-866-495-2621 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 years to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N = 1,251 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. % Placebo N = 1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in < 2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : migraine Renal and urinary disorders : pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, < 1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 mg to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N = 5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N = 29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications (4) ] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80 mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data ) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2 mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

At the 80 mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 days to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 ng/mL and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 hours to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is > 90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro. In an oral dose study with radio-labeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92% to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0% to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radio-labeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60% to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 years to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 kg to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 mL/min to \u2264 89 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min to \u2264 59 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 mL/min to \u2264 29 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10% to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 times and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 times and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (> 1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265 500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g. , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g. , micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u2265 3 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 = 22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47 years \u00b1 16 years (range 17 years to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16 years \u00b1 15 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206 ) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926 ) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137 ) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886 ) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940 ) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228 ) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride 1 or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 days to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 days to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 days to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1.0 days to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 years to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2 Common Adverse Reactions * in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration * Reported in \u2265 2% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. \u01c2 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort and epigastric discomfort.

Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, < 1% placebo) or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg per day, 1 mg per day, 2 mg per day or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 mg to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride succinate (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3,350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre-and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80 mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data). There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and day 4) and then 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2 mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. Motegrity (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2 mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 days to 4 days and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 ng/mL and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 hours to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is > 90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92% to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0% to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60% to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 years to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other) or body weight (37 kg to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 mL/min to \u2264 89 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min to \u2264 59 mL/min) and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 mL/min to \u2264 29 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10% to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6 and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 times and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg in males and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 times and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (> 1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265 500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u2265 3 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 = 22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%) and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47 years \u00b1 16 years (range 17 years to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16 years \u00b1 15 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3 Main Studies in the prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 days to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 days to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 days to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1.0 days to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc., at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 years to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration *Reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. \u01c2Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N=1,251\u2020 % Placebo N=1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u01c2 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in less than 2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders : Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : Migraine Renal and urinary disorders : Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, less than 1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 mg to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre-and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data). There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) tablets. However, due to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14)]. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production."

No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 days to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 ng/mL and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is greater than 90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92% to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0% to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60% to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 years to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 kg to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to less than or equal to 89 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to less than or equal to 59 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to less than or equal to 29 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10% to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (greater than 1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations greater than or equal to 500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations greater than or equal to 3 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 years to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the Prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1,237 received prucalopride 1mg or 2 mg and 1,247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

Across the six studies, the median time to first CSBM after dosing of prucalopride on day 1 ranged from 1.4 days to 4.7 days compared with 9.1 days to 20.6 days in the placebo group. The median time to first SBM after dosing on day 1 ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 days in the prucalopride group compared with 1 to 1.6 days in the placebo group. Alternative Efficacy Endpoint Using an alternative efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient who had at least 3 CSBMs and an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period and for at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. The differences in response rates between prucalopride and placebo in the 6 studies are shown in Table 5.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Ltd. at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2530 patients (1251 received prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride tablet once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride tablet 2 mg Once Daily N=1251 \u2020 % Placebo N=1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain \u2021 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 * Reported in 2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablet and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. \u2020 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride tablet 1 mg and increased to prucalopride tablet 2 mg. \u2021 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride tablet 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: migraine Renal and urinary disorders: pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride tablet 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride tablet 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride tablet once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride tablet 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride tablet 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride tablet for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride tablet was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride tablets (N=5715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose(about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2484 patients treated with prucalopride tablets 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2219h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17-95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37-161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co-administration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when co-administered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when co-administered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays ( e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests ( e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride tablets 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride tablets 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years. Table 3: Main Studies in the prucalopride Clinical Program Study Number Duration Study 1 (PRU-CRC-3001, NCT01116206) 12 Weeks Study 2 (SPD555-302, NCT01147926) 12 Weeks Study 3 (PRU-INT-6, NCT00488137) 12 Weeks Study 4 (PRU-USA-11, NCT00483886) 12 Weeks Study 5 (PRU-USA-13, NCT00485940) 12 Weeks Study 6 (SPD-555-401, NCT01424228) 24 Weeks Eligible patients required a history of chronic constipation defined as having fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (complete, spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM]) and 1 or more of the following symptoms for greater than 25% of bowel movements in the preceding 3 months, with symptoms onset more than 6 months prior to screening: Lumpy or hard stools Sensation of incomplete evacuation Straining at defecation Patients who never had SBMs were eligible. In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. In the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population in the 6 trials, 1237 received prucalopride tablets 1 or 2 mg and 1247 received placebo. Table 4 summarizes the results.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Suicidal Ideation and Behavior : Monitor patients for suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new-onset or worsening of depression. Instruct patients to discontinue prucalopride immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or they experience emerging suicidal thoughts or behaviors. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In clinical trials, suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Postmarketing cases of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new onset or worsening of depression have been reported within the first few weeks of starting prucalopride [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . A causal association between treatment with prucalopride and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Monitor all patients treated with prucalopride for new onset or worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members of patients to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and alert the healthcare provider. Instruct patients to discontinue prucalopride immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of these symptoms."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below represent 2,530 patients (1,251 received prucalopride 2 mg once daily and 1,279 received placebo) with CIC from 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration. In these trials overall, patients were primarily female (76%) and white (76%). The mean age was 47 years (range 17 to 95 years) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence (%) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of prucalopride once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double-blind placebo-controlled trials described above. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of patients receiving prucalopride and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo. in Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction Prucalopride 2 mg Once Daily N=1,251 Includes 93 patients who started on prucalopride 1 mg and increased to prucalopride 2 mg. % Placebo N=1,279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort. 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in <2% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg once daily include: Gastrointestinal disorders: Abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Decreased appetite Nervous system disorders: Migraine Renal and urinary disorders: Pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 70% (110 out of 157) reported it in the first week of treatment. Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73% (80 out of 110) of those patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1.8% of patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared to 1% of patients in the placebo group, and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall. Headache Of the patients who reported headache, 66% (157 out of 237) treated with prucalopride 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment. Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65% (102 out of 157) of those patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above, 5% of patients treated with 2 mg of prucalopride once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (2% prucalopride, 1% placebo), headache (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo), diarrhea (1% prucalopride, <1% placebo), or abdominal pain (1% prucalopride, 1% placebo). Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double-blind and 9 open-label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double-blind trials was 565 patient-years in the prucalopride group, 384 patient-years in the placebo group, and 2,769 patient-years in the double-blind and open-label clinical trials. Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR) per 1,000 patient-years for MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double-blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 patients out of 3,366; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 patients out of 2,019) in the placebo group. When combining the double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 patients out of 4,472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double-blind trials, one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily; none were reported in patients on placebo. In the open-label trials, two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation. Completed suicide was reported in two patients, previously treated with prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg; both discontinued prucalopride for at least one month prior to the event. Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of prucalopride was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population-based, retrospective, observational, cohort study of adults with constipation. New users of prucalopride (N=5,715) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3,350 (PEG) (N=29,372) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for MACE, pooled across four data sources. The 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre-specified safety margin of a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of prucalopride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: Dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Psychiatric disorders: Suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and visual hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis. No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area). In an oral pre-and post-natal development study in rats, prucalopride was administered at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. At the 80-mg/kg dose (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed, which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for prucalopride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from prucalopride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In an open-label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage, plasma and milk samples were collected at predose (day 1 and 4), and then 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (day 4) after a 2-mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days. Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2.65:1; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1.74 mcg/kg/day, which is about 6% of the maternal dose, adjusted for body weight. The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride have not been established in pediatric patients. Prucalopride was evaluated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by a 36-week double-blind extension study in patients 6 months to 17 years with functional constipation. The interim analysis of the primary endpoint showed that the number of spontaneous bowel movements per week over 12 weeks was similar between the prucalopride and placebo groups, indicating that the study was unlikely to demonstrate effectiveness. Therefore, the study was terminated early for futility. Adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in this study were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,484 patients treated with prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12-week duration in patients with CIC, 15% were 65 years of age and over, and 5% were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In an additional 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC (PRU-USA-26, NCT00627692), no unanticipated safety issues were identified. Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects. However, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance at least 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial). Prucalopride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, as determined from a 24-hour urine collection in the clinical trial) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Avoid prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2022h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine. In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results, the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BSEP, and MRP2 transporters) or induce CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, and 3A4) is low at the clinical concentration."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4 ) receptor agonist, is a gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis (high-amplitude propagating contractions [HAPCs]), which increases bowel motility. Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 3 , motilin or CCK-A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5-HT 4 receptor affinity by 150-fold or greater. In isolated GI tissues from various animal species, prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis. In rats and dogs, prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2-mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC, prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment. In addition, prucalopride 4 mg once daily (2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo. Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride, the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg, compared to an increase of 0.5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose, prucalopride does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range (tested up to 20 mg, 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Prucalopride administered once daily displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged treatment. With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride, pharmacokinetic steady-state is attained within 3 to 4 days, and steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/mL, respectively, with mean plasma AUC 0-24h of 109 ng\u2022h/mL. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.3. The terminal half-life is approximately 1 day. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high-fat meal (1,000 kcal total, 500 kcal from fat) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Distribution Prucalopride has a steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30%. Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. Non-renal elimination contributes up to about 35% of the total. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL/min. Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4, in vitro . In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, prucalopride made up 92 to 94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. There are 7 different known minor metabolites, the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) represents 0 to 1.7% of the total plasma exposure. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects, 60 to 65% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5% in feces. On average, 84.2% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13.3% of the dose was recovered in feces. Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces, with the most abundant metabolite (O-desmethyl prucalopride acid) accounting for 3.2% and 3.1% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively. None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3% of the dose. Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1,343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age (17 to 95 years), sex, race (89% white, 7% black, 4% other), or body weight (37 to 161 kg), after accounting for the effect of renal function. Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26% to 28% higher than in younger adult subjects. The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate, after accounting for the effect of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2-mg oral dose, the mean AUC 0-inf of prucalopride increased 1.23-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to \u226489 mL/min), 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to \u226459 mL/min), and 2.38-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to \u226429 mL/min), compared to subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg, C max and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20% higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. This effect is not considered to be clinically significant. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Coadministration of oral erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean C max by 40% and mean AUC 0-24h by 28%. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with prucalopride: warfarin, digoxin, paroxetine, or oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone). Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, increased the C max and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics (no more than a 10% change in AUC) were observed when coadministered with erythromycin, probenecid, cimetidine, or paroxetine.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg/kg/day. The finding is considered rodent-specific. No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day (exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice, respectively, based on AUC). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg in males and 5, 10, and 40 mg/kg in females. In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors, including hepatocellular adenomas, thyroid follicular adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas, pancreas islet cell adenomas, and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats. The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg/kg/day in male rats and 40 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios 556 times (males) and 495 times (females) the human dosage of 2 mg per day, based on AUC). There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in male rats and up to 10 mg/kg/day in female rats (exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats, respectively, based on AUC). In a 12-month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice, prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age (one-third of total dosage) and day 15 of age (two-thirds of total dosage). Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg (>1,600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day, based on AUC). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity. The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis. Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays, including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, micronucleus test in mice, Vitotox test, and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) studies. Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S. typhimurium TA100 strain, at concentrations \u2265500 mcg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis, including in vitro mammalian-based assays (e.g., mouse lymphoma assay, chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes) and in vivo tests (e.g., micronucleus test in mice, a UDS test, a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats, and a 32 P-postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies, including liver, mammary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissues). Based on the weight of evidence, prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential. Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg. At the highest dose of 80 mg/kg (about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg/day, based on body surface area), an increase in pre-coital interval, pseudo-pregnancies, and pre-implantation loss were seen. These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies, no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic C max . Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG-transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar (50 times the human therapeutic C max ). At concentrations \u22653 micromolar, concentration-dependent inhibition of the current was observed (IC 50 =22 micromolar; 1,100 times the human therapeutic C max ). In studies in pigs, minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride, at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic C max . In repeated-dose toxicology studies in male rats, increases in heart weight (up to 9%) were observed at doses of 20 mg/kg/day or higher (at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC). Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC). In dogs, no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram parameters, heart weight, or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested (the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC). In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human, canine, and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar (500 times the human clinical C max ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar (10 times the human clinical C max )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in 2,484 adult patients (Studies 1 to 6; see Table 3 ). Studies 1 through 5 were 12-week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment. Patients less than 65 years were dosed with prucalopride 2 mg once daily. In Studies 2 and 6, the geriatric patients started on prucalopride 1 mg once daily and, if necessary, the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg; of these patients 81% increased to 2 mg. Overall, the majority of patients were female (76%) and white (76%), and also included Asian (19%) and black (3%). The mean adult age was 47\u00b116 years (range 17 to 95 years) and the mean duration of constipation was 16\u00b115 years with 28% of patients having chronic constipation for at least 20 years.

In Study 1, eligibility also included sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade or the need for digital manipulation in more than 25% of bowel movements. In all studies, patients were excluded if constipation was due to secondary causes or suspected to be drug-induced. Efficacy was assessed using information provided by patients in a daily diary. Primary Efficacy Results For the primary efficacy endpoint, a responder was defined as a patient with an average of 3 or more CSBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period.
