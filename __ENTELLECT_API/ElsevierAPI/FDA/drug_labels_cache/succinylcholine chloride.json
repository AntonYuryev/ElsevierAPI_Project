      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 mg to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride with alkaline solutions."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine chloride may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine chloride administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. \u2022 The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. \u2022 To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. \u2022 The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. \u2022 Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. \u2022 Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ]. The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals , succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies , and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4, 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [ see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine chloride have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine chloride may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine chloride injection given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine chloride, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine chloride. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine chloride. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine chloride. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine chloride, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine chloride may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine chloride and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine chloride), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine chloride. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine chloride causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine chloride-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine chloride by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine chloride (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine chloride. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine chloride during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine chloride is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine chloride is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine chloride. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine chloride is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine chloride is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine chloride or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine chloride during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine chloride is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine chloride is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine chloride. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine chloride is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine chloride is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine chloride is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine chloride remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine chloride is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine chloride administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine chloride infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine chloride required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine chloride has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine chloride stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4, 5.6 ) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine chloride causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine chloride may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine chloride administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine chloride has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine chloride has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine chloride levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine chloride is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine chloride, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be administered under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, 1 mg per mL, may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride is 1 mg/kg [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is supplied in a single-dose, prefilled syringe, and does not require dilution for intravenous or intramuscular bolus dosing. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis: Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors: Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia: Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia: Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing, pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients. for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor ( RYR1 ) or dihydropyridine receptor ( CACNA1S ) variants [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature . 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting in apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over several decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase, in the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1 S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \u201ctrain of four\u201d). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.",

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis: Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors: Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia: succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia: Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increased Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, Solution Succinylcholine chloride supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia. Continuously monitor temperature and expired CO 2 . Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. Consult the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with prefilled syringe and the cap intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3, 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. \u2022 The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. \u2022 To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . \u2022 The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . \u2022 Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose prefilled syringes does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 minutes to 6 minutes. A 5 mg to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 minutes to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection is supplied in a single-dose, prefilled syringe, and does not require dilution for intravenous or intramuscular bolus dosing. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions. 2.7 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Assure that the needle or Needleless Luer Access Device (NLAD) is securely attached before beginning the injection. Visually inspect the syringe-needle or syringe-NLAD connection before and during drug administration.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 days to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 minutes to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multi-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg per mL to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg per mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multi-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg per mL or 2 mg per mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5. 2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. (2.1) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. (2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple- dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of succinylcholine chloride injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO2. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. \u2022 The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. \u2022 To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. \u2022 The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. \u2022 Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. \u2022 Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis: Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors: Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bradycardia: Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia Insusceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand.Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. Therisk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents.Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or familyhistory, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications ( 4 ),Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Signsconsistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia(e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia,and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successfultreatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinueall triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies.Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies includeadministration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinaryoutput, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pre-treatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [ see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection, USP. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [ see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. (2.1) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. (2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple- dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of succinylcholine chloride injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated: in patients with skeletal muscle myopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] in patients with known hypersensitivity to succinylcholine. Severe anaphylactic reactions to succinylcholine have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, which may result in severe hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] in patients with personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Skeletal muscle myopathies (4) Known hypersensitivity to succinylcholine (4) After the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (4) Known or suspected genetic susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (4)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. QUELICIN can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS.

      "WARNING WARNING RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST FROM HYPERKALEMIC RHABDOMYOLYSIS There have been rare reports of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death after the administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents. Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops cardiac arrest soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. However, extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have resulted in successful resuscitation in some reported cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be instituted concurrently. Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline (see PRECAUTIONS ). About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an IV bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ) . Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ) As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage.diately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ). Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see WARNINGS )."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Succinylcholine is contraindicated in persons with personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies and known hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia (see BOX WARNING ) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS (SEE BOX WARNING) GENERAL PRECAUTIONS When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. REDUCED PLASMA CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. PREGNANCY Risk Summary It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when non-pregnant. LABOR & DELIVERY Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to succinylcholine consist primarily of an extension of its pharmacological actions. Succinylcholine causes profound muscle relaxation resulting in respiratory depression to the point of apnea; this effect may be prolonged. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in rare instances. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperkalemia, prolonged respiratory depression or apnea, increased intraocular pressure, muscle fasciculation, jaw rigidity, postoperative muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis with possible myoglobinuric acute renal failure, excessive salivation, and rash. There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine. These reactions, in some cases, have been life threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Indoco Remedies Limited at +1-855-642-2594 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) (see PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. Avoid overburdening the circulation with a large volume of fluid. It is recommended that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, IV bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes."

Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple- dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required.

The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of succinylcholine chloride injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [ see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution to be used as a short-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocker for intravenous or intramuscular use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP contains succinylcholine chloride as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Succinylcholine Chloride, USP is chemically designated C 14 H 30 Cl 2 N 2 O 4 .2H 2 O and its molecular weight is 397.34. The chemical name of succinylcholine chloride is 2,2'-[(1,4-dioxo-1,4-butanediyl)bis(oxy)]bis[N,N,N-trimethyl-ethanaminium]dichloride. Succinylcholine chloride is a diquaternary base consisting of the dichloride salt of the dicholine ester of succinic acid. It is a white or almost white, odorless, crystalline powder, freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Succinylcholine Chloride Injection USP, 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) is intended for multiple-dose administration and contains preservative. Each 1 mL of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection USP, 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) multiple-dose fliptop vials contains: 20 mg of succinylcholine chloride, USP (equivalent to 22 mg of Succinylcholine Chloride dihydrate, USP), 1.8 mg of methylparaben and 0.2 mg of propylparaben as preservatives, 4.8 mg of sodium chloride as iso-osmotic agent, and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid as pH adjusters in water for injection. The pH of the solution is between 3.0 and 4.5, with an osmolarity of 0.338 mOsm/mL (calc.). succstr"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 Dosage and Administration 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO2. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. \u2022 The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. \u2022 To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14)]. \u2022 The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]. \u2022 Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]. \u2022 Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5)]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9)]. For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5)]. The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4)]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions. \u2022 For intravenous or intramuscular use only.

      "5 Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4)]. The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications ( 4), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5)]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2)]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced. \u2022 Anaphylaxis: Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors: Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings.

( 5.4 ) \u2022 Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bradycardia: Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 )"

      "8 Use In Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of s uccinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 Overdosage Overdosage with succinylcholine chloride may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine chloride administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4)]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]. Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11)]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14)]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]."

      "WARNING RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST FROM HYPERKALEMIC RHABDOMYOLYSIS There have been rare reports of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death after the administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents. Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops cardiac arrest soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. However, extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have resulted in successful resuscitation in some reported cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be instituted concurrently. Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ). As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see WARNINGS )."

It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia ( see BOX WARNING) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS ( see BOX WARNING) General When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e. Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 mg to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. Drug Interactions Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. Labor and Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation has resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 mg to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg and 4.3 mg per minute. Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine chloride injection. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine chloride injection may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine chloride injection given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes."

      "This drug should be used only by individuals familiar with its actions, characteristics and hazards.",
      "GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia: Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other: In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "boxed_warning": [
      "WARNING RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST FROM HYPERKALEMIC RHABDOMYOLYSIS There have been rare reports of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death after the administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents. Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops cardiac arrest soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. However, extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have resulted in successful resuscitation in some reported cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be instituted concurrently. Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline (see PRECAUTIONS ). About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ). As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see WARNINGS )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Succinylcholine is contraindicated in persons with personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies and known hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride, USP results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia: (see BOX WARNING ) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: (SEE BOX WARNING) General: When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity: Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. Drug Interactions: Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary: It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinal Considerations: Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. Labor and Delivery: Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility."
    ],
    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Risk Summary: It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinal Considerations: Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. Labor and Delivery: Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to succinylcholine consist primarily of an extension of its pharmacological actions. Succinylcholine causes profound muscle relaxation resulting in respiratory depression to the point of apnea; this effect may be prolonged. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in rare instances. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperkalemia, prolonged respiratory depression or apnea, increased intraocular pressure, muscle fasciculation, jaw rigidity, postoperative muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis with possible myoglobinuric acute renal failure, excessive salivation, and rash. There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine. These reactions, in some cases, have been life threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) (see PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults: For Short Surgical Procedures: The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures: The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. Avoid overburdening the circulation with a large volume of fluid. It is recommended that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics: For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). Intramuscular Use: If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent, or broken by hand."

(2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pre-treatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 mg to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride with alkaline solutions."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death from Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. succinylcholine can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients, the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increased in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents . 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection, in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "WARNING RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST FROM HYPERKALEMIC RHABDOMYOLYSIS There have been rare reports of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death after the administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents. Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops cardiac arrest soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. However, extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have resulted in successful resuscitation in some reported cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be instituted concurrently. Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline (see PRECAUTIONS ). About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an IV bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ). As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see WARNINGS )."

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Succinylcholine is contraindicated in persons with personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies and known hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. the clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia: (SEE BOX WARNING) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia: Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other: In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity: Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. Drug Interactions: Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. Labor and Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to succinylcholine consist primarily of an extension of its pharmacological actions. Succinylcholine causes profound muscle relaxation resulting in respiratory depression to the point of apnea; this effect may be prolonged. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in rare instances. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperkalemia, prolonged respiratory depression or apnea, increased intraocular pressure, muscle fasciculation, jaw rigidity, postoperative muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis with possible myoglobinuric acute renal failure, excessive salivation, and rash. There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine. These reactions, in some cases, have been life threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) (see PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults: For Short Surgical Procedures: The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures: The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. Avoid overburdening the circulation with a large volume of fluid. It is recommended that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics: For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, I.V. bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). Intramuscular Use: If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. Compatibility and Admixtures: Succinylcholine is acidic (pH 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Admixtures containing 1 to 2 mg/mL may be prepared by adding 1 g succinylcholine chloride to 1000 or 500 mL sterile solution, such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Admixtures of succinylcholine chloride must be used within 24 hours after preparation. Aseptic techniques should be used to prepare the diluted product. Admixtures of succinylcholine chloride should be prepared for single patient use only. The unused portion of diluted succinylcholine chloride should be discarded. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent, or broken by hand."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. \u2022 The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. \u2022 To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . \u2022 The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . \u2022 Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . \u2022 Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. \u2022 Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor ( RYR1 ) or dihydropyridine receptor ( CACNA1S ) variants. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ).

It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ).

The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Warnings Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia (see BOX WARNING ) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other: In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions (SEE BOX WARNING ) General When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity: Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. Drug Interactions Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential.Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. Pregnancy: Risk Summary It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. Labor and Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre\u00ad treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to succinylcholine consist primarily of an extension of its pharmacological actions. Succinylcholine causes profound muscle relaxation resulting in respiratory depression to the point of apnea; this effect may be prolonged. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in rare instances. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperkalemia, prolonged respiratory depression or apnea, increased intraocular pressure, muscle fasciculation, jaw rigidity, postoperative muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis with possible myoglobinuric acute renal failure, excessive salivation, and rash. There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine. These reactions, in some cases, have been life threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Overdosage with succinylcholine may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) (see PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage & Administration Section The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS) . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults: For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS :Pediatric Use). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use). Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes."

( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be administered under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] . Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, 1 mg per mL, may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride is 1 mg/kg [see W arnings and Precautions (5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is supplied in a single-dose, prefilled syringe, and does not require dilution for intravenous or intramuscular bolus dosing. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH 3.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions. 2.7 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Assure that the needle or Needleless Luer Access Device (NLAD) is securely attached before beginning the injection. Visually inspect the syringe-needle or syringe-NLAD connection before and during drug administration. Administration Technique Figure 1. Figure 1 Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 1. Inspect the outer packaging (plastic overwrap) and the syringe label by verifying: - plastic overwrap integrity - drug name - drug strength - fill volume - route of administration - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - sterile field applicability Do not use if package has been damaged 2. Open the outer packaging and remove the syringe from the plastic overwrap. Do not pop syringe through. 3. Perform visual inspection on the syringe by verifying: - absence of syringe damage - absence of external particles - absence of internal particles - proper drug color 4. Push plunger rod slightly while tip cap is still on to break the stopper loose. 5. Remove tip cap by twisting it off. (See Figure 2) Figure 2. Figure 2 6. Discard the tip cap. 7. Expel air bubble. 8. Connect the syringe to an appropriate injection connection depending on the route of administration. - Before injection, ensure that the syringe is securely attached to the needle or NLAD. 9. Depress plunger rod to deliver the required dose of medication. Ensure that pressure is maintained on the plunger rod during the entire administration. Waste residual medication per institutional policy. 10. Remove syringe from NLAD (if applicable) and discard into appropriate receptacle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life\u2011threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing, pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T\u2011waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia inpatients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non\u2011depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine\u2011induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting in apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over several decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase, in the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic\u2011thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. Case reports as well as exvivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic\u2011thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose prefilled syringes does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg/mL may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection is supplied in a single-dose, prefilled syringe, and does not require dilution for intravenous or intramuscular bolus dosing. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions. 2.7 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE CAUTION: Assure that the needle or Needleless Luer Access Device (NLAD) is securely attached before beginning the injection.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor ( CACNA1 S) variants [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting in apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase, in the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1 S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS.

      "WARNING RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST FROM HYPERKALEMIC RHABDOMYOLYSIS There have been rare reports of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death after the administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal muscle myopathy, most frequently Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents. Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops cardiac arrest soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. However, extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have resulted in successful resuscitation in some reported cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be instituted concurrently. Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline (see PRECAUTIONS ). About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an IV bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration (see PRECAUTIONS ). Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis (see WARNINGS ). Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase (see PRECAUTIONS ). As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see WARNINGS )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Succinylcholine is contraindicated in persons with personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies and known hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in patients after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury, because succinylcholine administered to such individuals may result in severe hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are not known."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Succinylcholine should be used only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of carbon dioxide. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. To avoid distress to the patient, succinylcholine should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine before unconsciousness is induced. Succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. Hyperkalemia (see BOX WARNING ) Succinylcholine should be administered with GREAT CAUTION to patients suffering from electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have massive digitalis toxicity, because in these circumstances succinylcholine may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. GREAT CAUTION should be observed if succinylcholine is administered to patients during the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems should receive succinylcholine with GREAT CAUTION because of the potential for developing severe hyperkalemia. Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of this problem. Consult literature references and the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. Other In both adults and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. It should not be used in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. Succinylcholine is acidic (pH = 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: (SEE BOX WARNING) GENERAL When succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. Succinylcholine should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Succinylcholine may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine will minimize this effect. Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine have been reported. Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine should be used carefully in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity. The likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine must be considered in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs). Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. In these patients, a 5 to 10 mg test dose of succinylcholine may be administered to evaluate sensitivity to succinylcholine, or neuromuscular blockade may be produced by the cautious administration of a 1 mg/mL solution of succinylcholine by slow intravenous infusion. Apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, diethylether, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS ). If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect should be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of succinylcholine. Genetic toxicology studies have not been completed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of succinylcholine. There are no studies to evaluate the potential impact of succinylcholine on fertility. PREGNANCY Risk Summary It is also not known whether succinylcholine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. Succinylcholine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Therefore, a higher proportion of patients may be expected to show increased sensitivity (prolonged apnea) to succinylcholine when pregnant than when nonpregnant. LABOR AND DELIVERY Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. While small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placental barrier, under normal conditions the quantity of drug that enters fetal circulation after a single dose of 1 mg/kg to the mother should not endanger the fetus. However, since the amount of drug that crosses the placental barrier is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulations, residual neuromuscular blockade (apnea and flaccidity) may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether succinylcholine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following succinylcholine administration to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. There are rare reports of ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who receive succinylcholine (see BOX WARNING ). Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

The syndrome often presents as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients are usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently (see WARNINGS ). Since it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following the second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents, e.g., atropine, may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to succinylcholine consist primarily of an extension of its pharmacological actions. Succinylcholine causes profound muscle relaxation resulting in respiratory depression to the point of apnea; this effect may be prolonged. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in rare instances. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperkalemia, prolonged respiratory depression or apnea, increased intraocular pressure, muscle fasciculation, jaw rigidity, postoperative muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis with possible myoglobinuric acute renal failure, excessive salivation, and rash. There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine. These reactions, in some cases, have been life threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) (see PRECAUTIONS )."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see WARNINGS ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. Avoid overburdening the circulation with a large volume of fluid. It is recommended that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1 to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient. Rarely, IV bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and cardiac arrest secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia. In such situations, an underlying myopathy should be suspected. Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants or pediatric patients may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. As in adults, the incidence of bradycardia in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes."

(2.1) See full prescribing information for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO2. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults.

For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation.

Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injectionsupplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for single patient use only.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia. Continuously monitor temperature and expired CO2. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. Consult the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increased Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injectionis administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "description": [
      "11. DESCRIPTION Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution to be used as a short-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocker for intravenous or intramuscular use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection contains succinylcholine chloride as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Succinylcholine Chloride, USP is chemically designated C 14 H 30 Cl 2 N 2 O 4 and its molecular weight is 361.31. The chemical name of succinylcholine chloride is ethanaminium, 2,2'-[(1,4-dioxo-1,4 butanediyl)bis(oxy)]bis[N,N,N-trimethyl-], dichloride. Succinylcholine chloride is a diquaternary base consisting of the dichloride salt of the dicholine ester of succinic acid. It is a white, odorless, slightly bitter powder, very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Succinylcholine Chloride Injection 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) is intended for multiple-dose administration and contains preservative. Each 1 mL of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) multiple-dose fliptop vials contains: 20 mg of succinylcholine anhydrous (equivalent to 22.65 mg of Succinylcholine Chloride, USP), 1.8 mg of methylparaben and 0.2 mg of propylparaben as preservatives, 4.70 mg of sodium chloride as iso-osmotic agent, and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid as pH adjusters in water for injection. The pH of the solution is between 3.0 and 4.5, with an osmolarity of 0.338 mOsm/mL (calc.). str"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] ."

(2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO2. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injectionmay be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injectionsupplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with alkaline solutions."

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia. Continuously monitor temperature and expired CO2. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia Succinylcholine administration has been associated with acute onset of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia following succinylcholine administration increases with the concomitant administration of volatile anesthetics. Malignant hyperthermia frequently presents as intractable spasm of the jaw muscles (masseter spasm) which may progress to generalized rigidity, increased oxygen demand, tachycardia, tachypnea and profound hyperpyrexia. Successful outcome depends on recognition of early signs, such as jaw muscle spasm, acidosis, or generalized rigidity to initial administration of succinylcholine for tracheal intubation, or failure of tachycardia to respond to deepening anesthesia. Skin mottling, rising temperature and coagulopathies may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Recognition of the syndrome is a signal for discontinuance of anesthesia, attention to increased oxygen consumption, correction of acidosis, support of circulation, assurance of adequate urinary output and institution of measures to control rising temperature. Intravenous dantrolene sodium is recommended as an adjunct to supportive measures in the management of malignant hyperthermia. Consult the dantrolene prescribing information for additional information about the management of malignant hyperthermic crisis. Continuous monitoring of temperature and expired CO 2 is recommended as an aid to early recognition of malignant hyperthermia. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increased Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injectionis administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "11. DESCRIPTION Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution to be used as a short-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocker for intravenous or intramuscular use. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection contains succinylcholine chloride as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Succinylcholine Chloride, USP is chemically designated C 14 H 30 Cl 2 N 2 O 4 and its molecular weight is 361.31. The chemical name of succinylcholine chloride is ethanaminium, 2,2'-[(1,4-dioxo-1,4 butanediyl)bis(oxy)]bis[N,N,N-trimethyl-], dichloride. Succinylcholine chloride is a diquaternary base consisting of the dichloride salt of the dicholine ester of succinic acid. It is a white, odorless, slightly bitter powder, very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Succinylcholine Chloride Injection 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) is intended for multiple-dose administration and contains preservative. Each 1 mL of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection 200 mg/10 mL (20 mg/mL) multiple-dose fliptop vials contains: 20 mg of succinylcholine anhydrous (equivalent to 22.65 mg of Succinylcholine Chloride, USP), 1.8 mg of methylparaben and 0.2 mg of propylparaben as preservatives, 4.70 mg of sodium chloride as iso-osmotic agent, and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid as pH adjusters in water for injection.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multi-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solutions containing from 1 mg per mL to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution containing 1 mg per mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multi-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg per mL or 2 mg per mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride injection solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5. 2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with succinylcholine chloride may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. This may be manifested by skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine chloride injection administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

(2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE Injection, USP with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE Injection, USP dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may be reduced by pre-treatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Visually inspect SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The effective dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP SSUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP solution in a refrigerator [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless.

(5.3) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine chloride may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pre-treatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4) ] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP administration. Consider avoiding use of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in these patients or verify the patient\u2019s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increased in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The effective dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE INJECTION, USP. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. (2.1) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. (2.1) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) See full prescribing information for succinylcholine chloride injection dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine chloride injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine chloride injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine chloride injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Visually inspect succinylcholine chloride injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple- dose vials does not require dilution before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store succinylcholine chloride injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg succinylcholine chloride injection given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg intravenous test dose of succinylcholine chloride injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of succinylcholine chloride injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted succinylcholine chloride solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of succinylcholine chloride injection and, hence, of relaxation. This diluted succinylcholine chloride solution containing 1 mg/mL succinylcholine may be administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine chloride injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine chloride injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further intravenous injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine chloride injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, succinylcholine chloride injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of succinylcholine chloride injection Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in single-dose vials must be diluted before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection supplied in multiple-dose vials does not require dilution before use. Succinylcholine chloride injection may be diluted to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Discard any unused portion of the diluted succinylcholine chloride solution. 2.6 Drug Incompatibility Succinylcholine chloride injection is acidic (pH is between 3.0 and 4.5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not mix succinylcholine chloride injection with alkaline solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. (5.2) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of succinylcholine chloride injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. (5.3) Hyperkalemia : succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. (5.4) Malignant Hyperthermia : Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. (5.5) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. (5.6) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of succinylcholine chloride injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine chloride injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) variants. [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid succinylcholine chloride injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When succinylcholine chloride injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine chloride injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If succinylcholine chloride injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine chloride injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine chloride injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of succinylcholine chloride injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of succinylcholine chloride injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use succinylcholine chloride injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer succinylcholine chloride injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Intravenous bolus administration of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . The effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u00b5g/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous or intramuscular use only. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosage after careful assessment of the patient. ( 2.1 ) Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for dosage recommendations, preparation instructions, and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is for intravenous or intramuscular use only. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be administered under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO 2 . The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient. To avoid distress to the patient, do not administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness has been induced [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . The occurrence of bradyarrhythmias with administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be reduced by pretreatment with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Visually inspect Succinylcholine Chloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer solutions that are not clear and colorless. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Risk of Medication Errors Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the prefilled syringe and cap intact, and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg test dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . For Long Surgical Procedures Continuous Intravenous Infusion The dosage of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administered by continuous intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. Diluted solutions containing from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . The more dilute solution (1 mg/mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and, hence, of relaxation. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, 1 mg per mL, may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per minute to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. The average rate of continuous intravenous infusion for an adult ranges between 2.5 mg per minute and 4.3 mg per minute. Monitor neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using Succinylcholine Chloride Injection by infusion in order to avoid overdose, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Intermittent intravenous injections of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Pediatric Patients For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is 2 mg/kg for infants and other small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the intravenous dose of Succinylcholine Chloride is 1 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age and 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Intramuscular Use in Adults and Pediatric Patients If a suitable vein is inaccessible, Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly at a dose of up to 3 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg to infants, older pediatric patients, or adults. The total dose administered by the intramuscular route should not exceed 150 mg. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. 2.5 Preparation of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is supplied in a single-dose, prefilled syringe, and does not require dilution for intravenous or intramuscular bolus dosing. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may be diluted for continuous intravenous infusion to 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in a solution such as: 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Prepare the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution for single patient use only. Store the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride solution in a refrigerator [2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F)] and use within 24 hours after preparation. Visually inspect the diluted Succinylcholine Chloride Injection solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. Some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Take necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Unintended administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may result in paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. ( 5.3 ) Hyperkalemia : Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia. ( 5.4 ) Malignant Hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia may occur, especially in individuals with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history. Discontinue triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and apply supportive therapies. ( 5.5 ) Bradycardia : Intravenous bolus administration may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. The incidence is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Ventricular Dysrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest, and Death From Hyperkalemic Rhabdomyolysis in Pediatric Patients There have been reports of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death secondary to acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia in apparently healthy pediatric patients who received succinylcholine. Many of these pediatric patients were subsequently found to have a skeletal muscle myopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose clinical signs were not obvious. The syndrome often presented as sudden cardiac arrest within minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. These pediatric patients were usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger. There have also been reports in adolescents. There may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner to which patients are at risk. A careful history and physical may identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy. A preoperative creatine kinase could identify some but not all patients at risk. When a healthy-appearing, pediatric patient develops cardiac arrest within minutes after administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic overdose, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram may alert the practitioner to peaked T-waves (an early sign). Administration of intravenous calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose with insulin, with hyperventilation have resulted in successful resuscitation in some of the reported cases. Extraordinary and prolonged resuscitative efforts have been effective in some cases. In addition, in the presence of signs of malignant hyperthermia, appropriate treatment should be initiated concurrently [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Because it is difficult to identify which patients are at risk, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.3 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors Administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.4 Hyperkalemia Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined. Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. Consider avoiding use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in these patients or verify the patient's baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to Succinylcholine Chloride Injection administration. 5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, succinylcholine may trigger malignant hyperthermia, a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection can induce malignant hyperthermia in patients with known or suspected susceptibility based on genetic factors or family history, including those with certain inherited ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine receptor ( CACNA1 S) variants [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process. Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature. 5.6 Bradycardia Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole. In both adult and pediatric patients the incidence of bradycardia, which may progress to asystole, is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. The incidence and severity of bradycardia is higher in pediatric patients than adults. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Pretreatment with anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine) may reduce the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias. 5.7 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure. Avoid Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in instances in which an increase in intraocular pressure is undesirable (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, penetrating eye injury) unless the potential benefit of its use outweighs the potential risk. 5.8 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis When Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is given over a prolonged period of time, the characteristic depolarization block of the myoneural junction (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). Prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness may be observed in patients manifesting this transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the patient, clinical pharmacology, and the experience and judgment of the clinician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably \"train of four\"). The use of an anticholinesterase drug such as neostigmine to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of muscle relaxation. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of muscle twitch has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma cholinesterase prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent. 5.9 Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in such patients. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If Succinylcholine Chloride Injection is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting in apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration. 5.10 Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients with Fractures or Muscle Spasms Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. 5.11 Increase in Intracranial Pressure Succinylcholine Chloride Injection may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection will minimize this effect. 5.12 Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration. 5.13 Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Hypokalemia or Hypocalcemia Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with hypokalemia (e.g., after severe vomiting, diarrhea, digitalisation and diuretic therapy) or hypocalcemia (e.g., after massive transfusions). Correct severe electrolyte disturbances when possible. In order to help preclude possible prolongation of neuromuscular block, monitor neuromuscular transmission throughout the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. 5.14 Risks due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. In emergency situations, however, it may be necessary to administer Succinylcholine Chloride Injection before unconsciousness is induced."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over several decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase, in the mother. Labor or Delivery Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Succinylcholine Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Succinylcholine Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of succinylcholine chloride have been established in pediatric patient age groups, neonate to adolescent. Because of a risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death from hyperkalemic rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients, reserve the use of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g., laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach, or for intramuscular use when a suitable vein is inaccessible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Intravenous bolus administration of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients (including infants) may result in profound bradycardia or, rarely, asystole.

The effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of succinylcholine chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 \u03bcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1 S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving Succinylcholine Chloride Injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] .
