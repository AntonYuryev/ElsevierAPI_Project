      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary statement. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] .

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* ( 2.3 ) Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 Units to 10,000 Units Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units Continuous 20,000 Units to 40,000 Units/24 hours *Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. \u2022 Cardiovascular Surgery ( 2.5 ) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose Not less than 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures \u2022 Extracorporeal Dialysis ( 2.8 ) For pediatric dosing see section 2.4 of full prescribing information. Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Do not use HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Administer this product by intravenous infusion. Do not admix with other drugs. This product should not be infused under pressure. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. To Open Tear outer wrap and remove solution container. For PVC bags, some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually. (Use aseptic technique) 1. Close flow control clamp of administration set. 2. Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated. NOTE: See full directions on administration set carton. 4. Suspend container from hanger. 5. Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber. 6. Open flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp. 7. Attach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture. 8. Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp. Warning: Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient's coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect With Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 Units to 10,000 Units Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 Units/24 hours to 40,000 Units/24 hours 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 units/kg to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 units/kg/hour to 30 units/kg/hour (continuous intravenous infusion); Infants less than 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children greater than 1 year of age: 18 units/kg/hour to 20 units/kg/hour (continuous intravenous infusion); Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage. Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 seconds to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants Other Than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT (With or Without Thrombosis): Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT (With or Without Thrombosis) ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin sodium. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . These patients may require a lower dose . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HIT with thrombosis. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and fatal outcomes. Once HIT (with or without thrombosis) is diagnosed or strongly suspected, all heparin sodium sources (including heparin flushes) should be discontinued and an alternative anticoagulant used. Future use of heparin sodium, especially within 3 to 6 months following the diagnosis of HIT (with or without thrombosis), and while patients test positive for HIT antibodies, should be avoided. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT (With or Without Thrombosis): Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT (With or Without Thrombosis). 5.4 Unresponsiveness to Heparin with Concomitant Use With Andexanet Alfa Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin leading to non-prolongation of activated clotting times and serious thrombotic events has occurred when unfractionated heparin was administered after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa. Use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be discontinued, and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be monitored by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT (With or Without Thrombosis), local irritation, hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: a. Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient's death. b. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication if unrecognized may be fatal. c. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) and Delayed Onset of HIT (With or Without Thrombosis): [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.5 )] Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. These complications are much more common after intramuscular use, and such use is not recommended. Hypersensitivity Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs have been reported with heparin use. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Others Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation, and hypervolemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7 ) \u2022 Andexanet alfa may reduce the efficacy of heparin when used concomitantly ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. 7.3 Unresponsiveness to Heparin With Concomitant Use With Andexanet Alfa Andexanet binds to heparin-bound antithrombin III (ATIII) and may reduce the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin may lead to serious and life-threatening thrombotic events. Use of andexanet alfa as an antidote for heparin has not been established. Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). If anticoagulation is needed, use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.4 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Prothrombin time \u2013 Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with warfarin, allow a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of heparin to elapse before blood is drawn to obtain a valid prothrombin time. Hyperaminotransferasemia Significant elevations of aminotransferase AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, rises that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution."

In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10,000 USP Units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 USP Units/24 hours infusion (see Data ) . Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP Units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding. Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin Units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about \u00bd hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products should be consulted. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -Sulfated O -Sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION is a sterile preparation of heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) for intravenous administration. It contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agent or added buffer. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. The pH range is 6.1 (5.0 \u2013 7.5) and the osmolarity mOsmol/L (calc.) is 155. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Each mL of the 50 USP Units per mL preparations contains: 50 USP Units of heparin sodium, 4.5 mg sodium chloride and 0.1 mg edetate disodium, anhydrous added as a stabilizer. Each mL of the 100 USP Units per mL preparations contains: 100 USP Units of heparin sodium, 4.5 mg sodium chloride and 0.1 mg edetate disodium, anhydrous added as a stabilizer. structural formula for heparin"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo . Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in syringes containing 5,000 units in 1 mL of heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection syringes to confirm the correct syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA Inc. at, LLC 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection syringes to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L- iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP, preservative-free is available in the following concentration: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride 5,000 USP units / 1 mL 7 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. hepar-struc-01.jpg"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hemorrhage : Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT : Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Elevations of serum aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure, or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.2 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious immune-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin\u2013naive individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. Monitor any degree of thrombocytopenia closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Evaluate patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium for HIT or HITT. 5.3 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.4 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with anti-thrombin deficiency. Consider measurement of anti-thrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.7 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions are: hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, hypersensitivity, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short or long-term anticoagulant therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage Vascular Disorders : Contusion, Vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases, Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ]. Histamine-like reactions: Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity : General hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders: Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Hyperkalemia. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. Elevations of serum aminotransferases : Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred patients who have received heparin. Others: Cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women ( 5.7 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection to a pregnant woman. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, more than 50 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of heparin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for heparin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from heparin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Clinical studies indicate that lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D- glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2) > (1) > (4) > (3) > (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection is a buffered, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of Heparin Sodium, USP derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity supplied in single dose containers for vascular administration. It contains no antimicrobial agents. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g ., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patient with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring.",
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to Weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

( 5.9 )",
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4\u00ad heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )\u200b] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. \u200bMeasure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported.

      "Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 )",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2 -D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin sodium injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Heparin sodium injection, USP (porcine), preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available as follows: Each mL of the 5,000 units per mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 6 mg sodium chloride; 15 mg benzyl alcohol (as a preservative); Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with parabens, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available.",
      "2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heparin Resistance [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations/mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. chemical structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin\u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Heparin Sodium Injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: \u2022 History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ; \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (e.g., anaphylactoid reactions) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]; \u2022 In whom suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin); \u2022 An uncontrolled active bleeding state [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. \u2022 History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITTS) ( 4 ) \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products ( 4 ) \u2022 In whom suitable blood coagulation tests cannot be performed at appropriate intervals ( 4 ) \u2022 An uncontrolled bleeding state, except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 4 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy o The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

( 2.2 ) 2.1 Preparation for Administration Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warning: Do not use plastic containers in series connection. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Do not use Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Do not admix with other drugs. Discard unused portion. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE for the free flex \u00ae Bag Leave bag in the overwrap until time of use. The intact port cap provides visual tamper evidence. Do not use if port cap is prematurely removed. Maintain strict aseptic technique during handling. To Open: Always inspect the bag before and after removal from the overwrap. Place the bag on a clean, flat surface. Starting in the bottom corner, peel the overwrap open and remove the bag. Check the bag for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, discard the bag. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Prepare for Administration: Immediately before connecting the infusion set, firmly grasp the BLUE infusion port cap with the arrow pointing away from the bag between index finger and thumb. Gently break off the port cap. The membrane of the infusion port is sterile, and disinfection before initial use is not necessary if proper aseptic handling technique is followed. Use a non-vented infusion set or close the air-inlet on a vented set. The BLUE infusion port is compatible with spike systems produced according to ISO 8536-4, with an external spike diameter of 5.5 to 5.7 mm. Close the roller clamp of the infusion set. Hold the base of the BLUE infusion port and insert the spike by rotating your wrist slightly until the spike is fully inserted. The port membrane contains a self-sealing septum that helps prevent leakage after removing the spike. The infusion port is not intended to be spiked more than once. Hang from the hole at the top of the bag. For Single Use Only. Discard unused portion. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance of Catheter Patency The recommended starting dose is 6 units per hour by intravenous infusion through an intravenous catheter to maintain catheter patency."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. ( 5.1 ) HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. ( 5.2 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy; discontinue heparin if HIT or HITT is suspected. ( 5.3 ) Heparin Resistance: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life threatening situations. ( 5.5 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding in Older Patients, Especially Women: A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 5.6 ) Laboratory Tests: Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure, or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.2 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious immune-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor-4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. HIT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT. 5.3 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 5.4 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.6 Increased Risk of Bleeding in Older Patients, Especially Women A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Heparin Sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: - Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy, including fatal cases. - Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. - Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Histamine-like reactions: Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifobatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of the antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women ( 5.6 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans (see Data ) . Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately >50 times the human daily dose. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of heparin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HEPARIN SODIUM IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal conditio n [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin Units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Intravenous solutions with heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) are sterile, nonpyrogenic fluids for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 200 USP Units; sodium chloride, 0.9 g; citric acid, anhydrous, 37 mg and dibasic sodium phosphate, heptahydrate, 430 mg added as buffers. Each liter contains the following electrolytes: Sodium 186.1 mEq; phosphate (as HPO 4 =) 32.1 mEq; citrate 5.8 mEq; and chloride 153.9 mEq. Osmolar concentration, 358 mOsmol/liter (calc.); pH 7.0 (5.0 \u2013 7.5). Heparin Sodium, USP is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose-6- sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2) > (1) > (4) > (3) > (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline compound freely soluble in water. Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, USP (Heptahydrate), is chemically designated (Na 2 HPO 4 7H 2 O), colorless or white granular salt freely soluble in water. Citric Acid, USP, anhydrous is chemically designated C 6 H 8 O 7, colorless, translucent crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The free flex \u00ae container closure system is not made from natural rubber latex, is Non-PVC and Non-DEHP. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin II, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin\u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular -Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other -Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BE Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-648-9517 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short-or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. Made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). hepstr"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring.",
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to Weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 )",
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4\u00ad heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )\u200b] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported.

      "Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 )",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2 -D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with parabens, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Each mL of the 5,000 units per mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 5 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Each mL of the 10,000 units per mL preparation contains: 10,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients (5.9) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion . Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-sulfated, O-sulfated, or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. heparin-spl-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see U se in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life-threatening situations. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Increased Risk of Bleeding in Older Patients, Especially Women: A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Laboratory Tests: Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure, or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.2 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia With Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious immune-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor-4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin\u2013naive individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.3 Unresponsiveness to Heparin with Concomitant Use With Andexanet Alfa Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin leading to non-prolongation of activated clotting times and serious thrombotic events has occurred when unfractionated heparin was administered after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa. Use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.5 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients , and patients with antithrombin deficiency . Consider measurement of antithrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium in Sodium Chloride Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. 5.7 Increased Risk of Bleeding in Older Patients, Especially Women A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.8 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.9 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: - Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy, including fatal cases. - Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. - Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Vascular disorders \u2013 Contusion, vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). HIT and HITT, including delayed onset [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \u2013 Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. Metabolism and nutrition disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. General disorders and administration site conditions \u2013 Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) \u2022 Andexanet alfa may reduce the efficacy of heparin when used concomitantly. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifobatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of the antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Unresponsiveness to Heparin with Concomitant Use With Andexanet Alfa Andexanet binds to heparin-bound antithrombin III (ATIII) and may reduce the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin may lead to serious and life-threatening thrombotic events. Use of andexanet alfa as an antidote for heparin has not been established. Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). If anticoagulation is needed, use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.4 Other Medications that May Interfere With Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Intravenous solutions with heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) are sterile, nonpyrogenic fluids for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 200 USP Units; sodium chloride, 0.9 g; citric acid, monohydrate, 40 mg and dibasic sodium phosphate, heptahydrate, 434 mg added as buffers. Each liter contains the following electrolytes: Sodium 186.4 mEq; phosphate (as HPO 4 =) 32.4 mEq, citrate 5.7 mEq and chloride 154 mEq. Osmolar concentration, 378 mOsmol/liter (calc.); pH 7.0 (5.0 \u2013 7.5). Heparin Sodium, USP is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose-6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2) > (1) > (4) > (3) > (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline compound freely soluble in water. Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, USP (heptahydrate), is chemically designated (Na 2 HPO 4 \u2219 7H 2 O), colorless or white granular salt freely soluble in water. Citric Acid, USP, hydrous (monohydrate) is chemically designated C 6 H 8 O 7 \u2219 H 2 O, colorless, translucent crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from either polyvinylchloride or polyolefin plastic. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers. Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin II, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero\u2011order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin sodium injection therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin sodium injection therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available as follows: Each mL of the 20,000 units per mL preparation contains: 20,000 USP heparin units (porcine); 10.42 mg benzyl alcohol (as a preservative); water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5 to 7.5). Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in TABLE 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available. Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin (2.3) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units. either diluted or in 50 to 100mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to10,000 units. either diluted or in 50 to 100mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20.000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infustion \u2020 Based on 150 ib (68 kg) patient.

      "4 Contraindications The use of Heparin Sodium Injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]; Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (e.g., anaphylactoid reactions) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]; In whom suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin); An uncontrolled active bleeding state [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITTS) (4) Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (4) In whom suitable blood coagulation tests cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (4) An uncontrolled bleeding state, except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (4)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 Warnings And Precautions 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration (5.1) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage (5.2) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS (5.3) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin (5.5, 5.6)"

      "6 Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 Drug Interactions 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human). Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding (7.2)"

      "8 Use in Specific Populations Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day (see DATA). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. (8.1) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. (8.2) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 Overdosage Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 Description Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary statement. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about \u00bd hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary statement. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about \u00bd hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h.

      "DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with parabens, is available as follows : Each mL of the 5,000 units per mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 5 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo . Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age. Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved two to four hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t 1\u20442 = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots."

      "WARNINGS Heparin is not intended for intramuscular use. Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypersensitivity ). Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage. Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular \u2014Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic \u2014Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal \u2014Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. Coagulation Testing When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be regulated by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be promptly discontinued (see OVERDOSAGE ). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops (see Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis ), the heparin product should be discontinued, and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered, if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) See WARNINGS . Heparin Resistance \u2014Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women \u2014A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants \u2014Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors \u2014Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet- aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions \u2014Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia \u2014Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin. Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta, based on human and animal studies. Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Exercise caution when administering HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a nursing mother (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric Use ). Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials (see WARNINGS, Fatal Medication Errors ). Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Clinical studies indicate that lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient\u2019s death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal. (c) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) and Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT See WARNINGS . Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. These complications are much more common after intramuscular use, and such use is not recommended. Hypersensitivity Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Certain episodes of painful, ischemic and cyanosed limbs have in the past been attributed to allergic vasospastic reactions. Whether these are in fact identical to the thrombocytopenia-associated complications, remains to be determined. Miscellaneous Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding. Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of Heparin Effect \u2014When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial prior to administration of the drug to a patient (see WARNINGS, Fatal Medication Errors ). The 1 mL vial must not be confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of inappropriate strength. Confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every four hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn four to six hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time. This is about five hours after the last IV bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. If continuous IV heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time. In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering. Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE (based on 150 lb [68 kg] patient) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution or Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism. The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for seven days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS ). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate are advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated. There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters. Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units/1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin sodium injection therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin sodium injection therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in TABLE 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available. Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Injection (2.3) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours Or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient.

      "A6 DVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human). Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding (7.2)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see DATA] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. (8.1) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. (8.2) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. (8.4) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-sulfated, O-sulfated, or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Injection \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of heparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (e.g., anaphylactoid reactions) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] In whom suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin) An uncontrolled active bleeding state [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation Severe thrombocytopenia ( 4 ) When suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals ( 4 ) An uncontrolled active bleeding state, except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 4 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use this product in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 333 units/kg subcutaneously Every 12 hours 250 units/kg subcutaneously Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units Continuous 20,000 units/24 hours to 40,000 units/24 hours * Based on 68 kg patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. \u2022 Cardiovascular Surgery ( 2.5 ) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose not less than 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures \u2022 Low-dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism ( 2.6 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial Dose 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery Every 8 to 12 hours 5,000 units \u2022 Extracorporeal dialysis ( 2.9 ) Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour if manufacturers' recommendations are not available 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \"catheter lock flush\" vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is incompatible with certain substances in solution (e.g., alteplase, amikacin sulfate, atracurium besylate, ciprofloxacin, cytarabine, daunorubicin, droperidol, erythromycin lactobionate, gentamicin sulfate, idarubicin, kanamycin sulfate, mitoxantrone HCl, polymyxin B sulfate, promethazine HCl, streptomycin sulfate, tobramycin sulfate). Consult specialized references to verify with which substances incompatibilities have been noted, as compatibility may depend on concentration, temperature, time, and other variables. Administer HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is not intended for intramuscular (IM) use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injections. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Based on 68 kg patient Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 333 units/kg subcutaneously Every 12 hours 250 units/kg subcutaneously Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 units to 40,000 units per 24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 units/kg to 100 units/kg ( intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 units/kg/hour to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants less than 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children greater than 1 year of age: 18 units/kg/hour to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 seconds to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.6 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1] ) . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2013 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2013 During and immediately following: (a) spinal puncture or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2013 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2013 Ulcerative lesions, continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine, and clinical settings in which stress-induced gastrointestinal hemorrhage is possible. \u2022 Other \u2013 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis, severe renal disease, or in patients with indwelling catheters. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome\" can occur in neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulation in infusion solutions, including HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION. The \"gasping syndrome\" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION (HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION contains 9.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.5 Unresponsiveness to Heparin with Concomitant Use with Andexanet Alfa Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin leading to non-prolongation of activated clotting times and serious thrombotic events has occurred when unfractionated heparin was administered after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa. Use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.6 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.7 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.8 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.10 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \u2022 Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: - Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. - Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. - Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Local irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma, or ulceration have occurred following deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because such reactions occur more frequently after intramuscular administration, the IM route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injection. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations; asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occur less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. \u2022 Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Andexanet alfa may reduce the efficacy of heparin when used concomitantly ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDs (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. 7.3 Unresponsiveness to Heparin with Concomitant Use with Andexanet Alfa Andexanet binds to heparin-bound antithrombin III (ATIII) and may reduce the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin may lead to serious and life-threatening thrombotic events. Use of andexanet alfa as an antidote for heparin has not been established. Avoid use of heparin after use of andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). If anticoagulation is needed, use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.4 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines, or intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproductive studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 USP units/24 hours infusion (see Data ) . Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of heparin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \"gasping syndrome\" occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received benzyl alcohol as a preservative in infusion solutions. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. When prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION (HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION contains 9.45 mg of benzyl alcohol) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for protamine sulfate injection. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N- acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is a sterile preparation of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal tissue, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is intended for intravenous or deep subcutaneous administration. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. For formulations preserved with benzyl alcohol, each mL of the 1,000 UPS units and 5,000 USP units per mL preparations contains: heparin sodium 1,000 UPS units or 5,000 USP units; 9 mg sodium chloride; 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as preservative. Each mL of the 10,000 USP units per mL preparations contains: heparin sodium 10,000 USP units; 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as preservative. The preservative-free product contains (per mL): 1,000 USP units of heparin sodium and 9 mg sodium chloride. When necessary, the pH of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is adjusted with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. The pH range is 5.0 to 7.5. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection syringe to ensure that the 1 mL syringe is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d syringe or other 1 mL syringe of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL syringe includes a red cautionary statement. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin sodium injection is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin sodium in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Certain glass syringes may malfunction, break or clog when connected to some Needleless Luer Access Devices (NLADs) and needles. This syringe has a larger internal syringe tip and an external collar (luer collar). The external collar must remain attached to the syringe. Data show that the syringe achieves acceptable connections with the BD Eclipse\u2122 Needle and the Terumo SurGuard2\u2122 Safety Needle and with the following non-center post NLADs: Alaris SMARTSITE\u2122, B-Braun ULTRASITE\u2122, BD-Q SYTE\u2122, Maximum MAX PLUS\u2122, and B-Braun SAFSITE\u2122. The data also show acceptable connections are achieved to the center post ICU Medical CLAVE\u2122. However, spontaneous disconnection of this glass syringe from needles and NLADs with leakage of drug product may occur. Assure that the needle or NLAD is securely attached before beginning the injection. Visually inspect the glass syringe-needle or glass syringe\u2013NLAD connection before and during drug administration. Refer to Figure 1 for syringe diagram. Figure 1 Inspect the outer packaging (plastic tube) by verifying: -plastic tube integrity -drug name -drug strength -dose volume -route of administration -expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired -sterile field applicability Do not use if package has been damaged. 2. Remove the plastic tube cap of the outer packaging to access the syringe. 3. Remove the syringe from the plastic tube. 4. Perform visual inspection on the syringe by verifying: -absence of syringe damage -absence of external particles -absence of internal particles -proper drug color -expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired -drug name -drug strength -dose volume -route of administration -sterile field applicability 5. Push plunger rod slightly to break the stopper loose while tip cap is still on. 6. Remove tip cap by twisting it off. (See Figure 2 ) Figure 2 7. Discard the tip cap. 8. Expel air bubble. 9. Adjust dose by expelling extra volume (where applicable) from the syringe into sterile material prior to administration. 10. Connect the syringe to appropriate injection connection depending on route of administration. Before injection, ensure that the syringe is securely attached to the needle or needleless luer access device (NLAD). 11. Depress plunger rod to deliver medication. Ensure that pressure is maintained on the plunger rod during the entire administration. 12. Remove syringe from NLAD (if applicable) and discard into appropriate receptacle. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped. NOTES: -All steps must be done sequentially - Do not autoclave syringe - Do not use this product on a sterile field -Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time -This product is for single dose only; discard unused portion Figure 1 Figure 2 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin sodium use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin sodium, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin sodium to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin sodium injection by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 27-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin sodium, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium injection immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium injection, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin sodium injection was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin sodium. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin sodium ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in syringes containing 5,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection syringes to confirm the correct syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin sodium in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin sodium. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin sodium is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin sodium dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin sodium and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin sodium, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin sodium has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin sodium, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin sodium is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin sodium doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin sodium should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin sodium, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin sodium. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin sodium, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin sodium is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin sodium dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin sodium and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin sodium is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin sodium is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin sodium exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin sodium via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin sodium intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin sodium is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin sodium in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin sodium use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection syringes to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin sodium. Lower doses of heparin sodium may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin sodium overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin sodium effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin sodium units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin sodium is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin sodium is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of protamine sulfate injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin sodium interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin sodium inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin sodium also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin sodium does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin sodium; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin sodium. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin sodium. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin sodium is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin sodium is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin sodium does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin sodium is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin sodium undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin sodium, may have higher plasma levels of heparin sodium and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.2 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Certain glass syringes may malfunction, break or clog when connected to some Needleless Luer Access Devices (NLADs) and needles. This syringe has a larger internal syringe tip and an external collar (luer collar). The external collar must remain attached to the syringe. Data show that the syringe achieves acceptable connections with the BD Eclipse\u2122 Needle and the Terumo SurGuard2\u2122 Safety Needle and with the following non-center post NLADs: Alaris SMARTSITE\u2122, B-Braun ULTRASITE\u2122, BD-Q SYTE\u2122, Maximum MAX PLUS\u2122, and B-Braun SAFSITE\u2122. The data also show acceptable connections are achieved to the center post ICU Medical CLAVE\u2122. However, spontaneous disconnection of this glass syringe from needles and NLADs with leakage of drug product may occur. Assure that the needle or NLAD is securely attached before beginning the injection. Visually inspect the glass syringe-needle or glass syringe-NLAD connection before and during drug administration. Refer to Figure 1 for syringe diagram. Figure 1 1. Inspect the outer packaging (plastic tube) by verifying: - plastic tube integrity - drug name - drug strength - dose volume - route of administration - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - sterile field applicability Do not use if package has been damaged. 2. Remove the plastic tube cap of the outer packaging to access the syringe. 3. Remove the syringe from the plastic tube. 4. Perform visual inspection on the syringe by verifying: - absence of syringe damage - absence of external particles - absence of internal particles - proper drug color - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - drug name - drug strength - dose volume - route of administration - sterile field applicability 5. Push plunger rod slightly to break the stopper loose while tip cap is still on. 6. Remove tip cap by twisting it off. (See Figure 2) Figure 2 7. Discard the tip cap. 8. Expel air bubble. 9. Adjust dose by expelling extra volume (where applicable) from the syringe into sterile material prior to administration. 10. Connect the syringe to appropriate injection connection depending on route of administration. Before injection, ensure that the syringe is securely attached to the needle or needleless luer access device (NLAD). 11. Depress plunger rod to deliver medication. Ensure that pressure is maintained on the plunger rod during the entire administration. 12. Remove syringe from NLAD (if applicable) and discard into appropriate receptacle. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped. NOTES: - All steps must be done sequentially - Do not autoclave syringe - Do not use this product on a sterile field - Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time - This product is for single dose only; discard unused portion CSFW 2 - corrected smaller from Word Figure 2 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and syringes containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm the correct vial or syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations/mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP, preservative-free is available in the following concentrations: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride 5,000 USP units/1 mL 7 mg 5,000 USP units/0.5 mL 5 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. chemical structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ].

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin\u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular -Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical -During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic -Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal -Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other -Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BE Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-648-9517 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short-or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others -Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each 0.5 mL of the 5,000 units per 0.5 mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); Water for Injection q.s.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma. Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials (contain 10.5 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Local irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions - Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans possessing anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6\u2219sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is available in the following concentrations/mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol pH 5.0\u20137.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 0.01 mL 5,000 USP units 7 mg 0.01 mL 10,000 USP units 5 mg 0.01 mL Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously development of hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2- acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Figure Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. Made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available as follows: Each mL of the 20,000 units per mL preparation contains: 20,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 0.01 mL benzyl alcohol (as a preservative); Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0-7.5)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.2 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Certain glass syringes may malfunction, break or clog when connected to some Needleless Luer Access Devices (NLADs) and needles. This syringe has a larger internal syringe tip and an external collar (luer collar). The external collar must remain attached to the syringe. Data show that the syringe achieves acceptable connections with the BD Eclipse\u2122 Needle and the Terumo SurGuard2\u2122 Safety Needle and with the following non-center post NLADs: Alaris SMARTSITE\u2122, B-Braun ULTRASITE\u2122, BD-Q SYTE\u2122, Maximum MAX PLUS\u2122, and B-Braun SAFSITE\u2122. The data also show acceptable connections are achieved to the center post ICU Medical CLAVE\u2122. However, spontaneous disconnection of this glass syringe from needles and NLADs with leakage of drug product may occur. Assure that the needle or NLAD is securely attached before beginning the injection. Visually inspect the glass syringe-needle or glass syringe-NLAD connection before and during drug administration. Refer to Figure 1 for syringe diagram. Figure 1 1. Inspect the outer packaging (plastic tube) by verifying: - plastic tube integrity - drug name - drug strength - dose volume - route of administration - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - sterile field applicability Do not use if package has been damaged. 2. Remove the plastic tube cap of the outer packaging to access the syringe. 3. Remove the syringe from the plastic tube. 4. Perform visual inspection on the syringe by verifying: - absence of syringe damage - absence of external particles - absence of internal particles - proper drug color - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - drug name - drug strength - dose volume - route of administration - sterile field applicability 5. Push plunger rod slightly to break the stopper loose while tip cap is still on. 6. Remove tip cap by twisting it off. (See Figure 2) Figure 2 7. Discard the tip cap. 8. Expel air bubble. 9. Adjust dose by expelling extra volume (where applicable) from the syringe into sterile material prior to administration. 10. Connect the syringe to appropriate injection connection depending on route of administration. Before injection, ensure that the syringe is securely attached to the needle or needleless luer access device (NLAD). 11. Depress plunger rod to deliver medication. Ensure that pressure is maintained on the plunger rod during the entire administration. 12. Remove syringe from NLAD (if applicable) and discard into appropriate receptacle. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped. NOTES: - All steps must be done sequentially - Do not autoclave syringe - Do not use this product on a sterile field - Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time - This product is for single dose only; discard unused portion CSFW 2 - corrected smaller from Word Figure 2 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available.",

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and syringes containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm the correct vial or syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heparin Resistance [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ].

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin sodium injection therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin sodium injection therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available as follows: Each mL of the 20,000 units per mL preparation contains: 20,000 USP heparin units (porcine); 10.42 mg benzyl alcohol (as a preservative); water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5 to 7.5). Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \"catheter lock flush\" vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to Weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4\u00ad- heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact McKesson Corporation dba SKY Packaging at 1-888-243-4363 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: \u25e6 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u25e6 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u25e6 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet- aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D\u00ad-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L\u00ad-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin sodium injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin sodium injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Heparin sodium injection, USP (porcine), preserved with benzyl alcohol, is available as follows: Each mL of the 5,000 units per mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 6 mg sodium chloride; 15 mg benzyl alcohol (as a preservative); Water for Injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer heparin sodium by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin sodium injection therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin sodium injection therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Figure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Initial dose Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin . Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.",
      "Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of protamine sulfate injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium, USP (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations/mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.4 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.4 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.4 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* (2.3) Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Subsequent Doses 5,000 Units to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 Units to 40,000 Units every 24 hours *Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. Cardiovascular Surgery (2.5) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose Greater than or equal to 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures Extracorporeal Dialysis (2.8) Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. For pediatric dosing, see section 2.4 of full prescribing information. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. This product should be administered by intravenous infusion only. Do not use Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Do not admix with other drugs. Discard unused portion. Do not use plastic containers in series connection. This product should not be infused under pressure. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose* Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Subsequent Doses 5,000 Units to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 Units to 40,000 Units every 24 hours * Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 units/kg to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 units/kg/hour to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants less than 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children greater than 1 year of age: 18 units/kg/hour to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. (5.1) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. (5.2) HIT or HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. (5.3) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy; discontinue heparin in HIT or HITT is suspected. (5.4) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. (5.5) Heparin Resistance: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. (5.6) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life-threatening situations. (5.7) Hyperkalemia: Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients (5.8) Elevations of serum aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. (5.9) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving HEPARIN SODIUM. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HITT. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin\u2013naive individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Consider measurement of anti-thrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. 5.8 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.9 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact B. Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-227-2862 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10)] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Vascular Disorders \u2013 Contusion, Vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases, and Thrombocytopenia \u2013 [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and 5.4) ] Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders \u2013 Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \u2013 Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. (7) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 USP units/24 hours infusion [ see Data ] . In pregnant animals, doses up to 10 times higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

In pregnant animals, doses up to 10 times higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of alpha-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate (1), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- alpha-D-glucose 6-sulfate (2), beta-D-glucuronic acid (3), 2-acetamido-2- deoxy-alpha-D-glucose (4), and alpha-L-iduronic acid (5). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection is a sterile, single-dose, clear, nonpyrogenic solution prepared from Heparin Sodium USP (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa and standardized for use as an anticoagulant) in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection. It is to be administered by intravenous injection. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. The pH range is 7.0 (6.8-7.2) and the osmolarity mOsmol/L (calc.) is 206. The concentration of electrolytes is 109 mEq/L Sodium, 77 mEq/L Chloride, 32 mEq/L Phosphate, and 6 mEq/L Citrate. 50 USP units/mL: Each 100 mL of the 25,000 USP units per 500 mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP units of heparin sodium, 0.45 g Sodium Chloride USP, 0.43 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate USP, 0.037 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, and Water for Injection USP until quantity sufficient. 100 USP units/mL: Each 100 mL of the 25,000 USP units per 250 mL preparation contains: 10,000 USP units of heparin sodium, 0.45 g Sodium Chloride USP, 0.43 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate USP, 0.037 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, and Water for Injection USP until quantity sufficient. The plastic container is made from a multilayered film specifically developed for parenteral drugs. The solution contact layer is a rubberized copolymer of ethylene and propylene. The container is nontoxic and biologically inert. The container-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration. The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary. The plastic container is not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP. The closure system has two ports; the one for the administration set has a tamper evident plastic protector. heparin sodium chemical formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 ) ] . Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patient with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use this product in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated, O -sulfated, or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 units to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP by intravenous injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 units/24 hours to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection syringe to ensure that the 1 mL syringe is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d syringe or other 1 mL syringe of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts and hematocrits during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 68 kg patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours Or Every 12 hours 8,000 units to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP by intravenous injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 units/24 hours to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.5 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.6 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available. 2.10 Administration Technique Figure 1: Outer Packaging and Prefilled Syringe NOTES: - Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time. - Do not dilute for intravenous push. - Do not re-sterilize the syringe. - Do not use this product on a sterile field. - This product is for single dose only. 1.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in syringes containing a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL (5,000 units per 0.5 mL). Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection syringes to confirm the correct syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy o The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.6 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Pediatric dosing is not achievable with the prefilled syringe presentation. Use another heparin product presentation when dosing pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Each 0.5 mL of Heparin Sodium Injection, USP contains: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride 5,000 USP units 2.5 mg pH 5.0-7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. hepar-struc-01.jpg"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]."

Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* ( 2.3 ) Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Subsequent Doses 5,000 to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 Units every 24 hours * Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. Cardiovascular Surgery ( 2.5 ) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose Greater than or equal to 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures Extracorporeal Dialysis ( 2.8 ) Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. For pediatric dosing see section 2.4 of full prescribing information. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. This product should be administered by intravenous infusion. Do not use Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Do not admix with other drugs. Discard unused portion. Do not use plastic containers in series connection. This product should not be infused under pressure. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units Subsequent Doses 5,000 to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 Units every 24 hours 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 units/kg to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 units/kg/hour to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 units/kg/hour to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. ( 5.2 ) HIT or HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. ( 5.3 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy; discontinue heparin in HIT or HITT is suspected. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. ( 5.5 ) Heparin Resistance: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life-threatening situations. ( 5.7 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.8 ) Elevations of serum aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving HEPARIN SODIUM. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2013 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. Surgical \u2013 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2013 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2013 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2013 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HITT. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin\u2013naive individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Consider measurement of anti-thrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.8 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.9 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact B. Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-227-2862 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Vascular Disorders \u2013 Contusion, Vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases, and Thrombocytopenia \u2013 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 and 5.4 )] Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders \u2013 Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \u2013 Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 USP units/24 hours infusion [see Data] . In pregnant animals, doses up to 10 times higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 5% DEXTROSE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN 5% DEXTROSE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 5% DEXTROSE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN 5% DEXTROSE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HEPARIN SODIUM IN 5% DEXTROSE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of alpha-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate (1), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- alpha-D-glucose 6-sulfate (2), beta-D-glucuronic acid (3), 2-acetamido-2- deoxy-alpha-D-glucose (4), and alpha-L-iduronic acid (5). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution prepared from Heparin Sodium USP (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa and standardized for use as an anticoagulant) and Hydrous Dextrose USP. It is to be administered by intravenous injection. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. The pH range is 5.6 (4.5 \u2013 7.0) and the osmolarity mOsmol/L (calc.) is 315. The concentration of electrolytes is 38 mEq/L Sodium, 30 mEq/L Phosphate, and 15 mEq/L Citrate. 40 USP units/mL: Each 100 mL of the 20,000 USP units per 500 mL preparation contains: 4,000 USP units of heparin sodium, 5 g Hydrous Dextrose USP, 0.41 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, 0.093 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, 0.0686 g Sodium Metabisulfite NF (antioxidant), and Water for Injection USP until quantity sufficient. 50 USP units/mL: Each 100 mL of the 25,000 USP units per 500 mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP units of heparin sodium, 5 g Hydrous Dextrose USP, 0.41 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, 0.093 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, 0.0686 g Sodium Metabisulfite NF (antioxidant), and Water for Injection USP until quantity sufficient. 100 USP units/mL: Each 100 mL of the 25,000 USP units per 250 mL preparation contains: 10,000 USP units of heparin sodium, 5 g Hydrous Dextrose USP, 0.41 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, 0.093 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP, 0.0686 g Sodium Metabisulfite NF (antioxidant), and Water for Injection USP until quantity sufficient. The plastic container is made from a multilayered film specifically developed for parenteral drugs. It contains no plasticizers and exhibits virtually no leachables. The solution contact layer is a rubberized copolymer of ethylene and propylene. The container is nontoxic and biologically inert. The container-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration. The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary. The plastic container is not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP. The closure system has two ports; the one for the administration set has a tamper evident plastic protector.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patient with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 and 5.4 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] .

      "DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age. Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved two to four hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t 1\u20442 = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Heparin Sodium Injection is indicated for: Anticoagulant therapy in prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension; Low-dose regimen for prevention of postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major abdominothoracic surgery or who, for other reasons, are at risk of developing thromboembolic disease (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION ); Prophylaxis and treatment of pulmonary embolism; Atrial fibrillation with embolization; Treatment of acute and chronic consumptive coagulopathies (disseminated intravascular coagulation); Prevention of clotting in arterial and cardiac surgery; Prophylaxis and treatment of peripheral arterial embolism. Heparin may also be employed as an anticoagulant in blood transfusions, extracorporeal circulation, and dialysis procedures."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Heparin sodium should NOT be used in patients with the following conditions: Severe thrombocytopenia; When suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin); An uncontrollable active bleeding state (see WARNINGS ), except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Heparin is not intended for intramuscular use. Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Hypersensitivity). Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage. Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular\u2014Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical\u2014During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic\u2014Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal\u2014Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other\u2014Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. Coagulation Testing When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be regulated by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be promptly discontinued (see OVERDOSAGE ). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops (see Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis), the heparin product should be discontinued, and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered, if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) See WARNINGS . Heparin Resistance\u2014Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women\u2014A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants\u2014Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors\u2014Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet- aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions\u2014Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia\u2014Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin. Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta, based on human and animal studies. Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Exercise caution when administering HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a nursing mother (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION , Pediatric Use). Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials (see WARNINGS , Fatal Medication Errors). Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women (see PRECAUTIONS , General). Clinical studies indicate that lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient\u2019s death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal. (c) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) and Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT See WARNINGS . Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. These complications are much more common after intramuscular use, and such use is not recommended. Hypersensitivity Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Certain episodes of painful, ischemic and cyanosed limbs have in the past been attributed to allergic vasospastic reactions. Whether these are in fact identical to the thrombocytopenia-associated complications, remains to be determined. Miscellaneous Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding. Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of Heparin Effect\u2014When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial prior to administration of the drug to a patient (see WARNINGS , Fatal Medication Errors). The 1 mL vial must not be confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of inappropriate strength. Confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every four hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn four to six hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time. This is about five hours after the last IV bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. If continuous IV heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time. In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering. Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants (see WARNINGS , Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism. The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for seven days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS ). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate are advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated. There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters. Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units/1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts. DOSAGE"

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Do not use Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Administer this product by intravenous infusion. Do not admix with other drugs. Do not use flexible container in series connections. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient's coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain a PTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain a PTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving HEPARIN SODIUM. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see ADVERSE REACTIONS 6- (6.1)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12- (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) HIT is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HIT with thrombosis. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.3)]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see OVERDOSAGE 10 ]. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2- (2.2)]. 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6 )]. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.1)] \u2022 Hemorrhage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.2)] \u2022 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.3)] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.4)] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.6)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.7)] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \u2022 Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2013 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. \u2013 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) and Thrombocytopenia: [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.3 and 5.4)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.7)]. \u2022 Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines, or intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Prothrombin time \u2013 Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with warfarin, allow a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of heparin to elapse before blood is drawn to obtain a valid prothrombin time."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 units/24 hours infusion [see Data]. In pregnant animals, doses up to10 times higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8- (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2- (2.4)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5- (5.2)]. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12- (12.3)]."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of heparin effect. When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin Units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about \u00bd hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-Sulfated O-Sulfated or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.45% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION is a sterile preparation of heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) for intravenous administration. It contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agent or added buffer. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. The pH range is 6.1 (5.0 \u2013 7.5) and the osmolarity mOsmol/L (calc.) is 155. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Each mL of the 50 USP units per mL preparations contains: 50 USP units of heparin sodium, 4.5 mg sodium chloride and 0.1 mg edetate disodium, anhydrous added as a stabilizer. Each mL of the 100 USP units per mL preparations contains: 100 USP units of heparin sodium, 4.5 mg sodium chloride and 0.1 mg edetate disodium, anhydrous added as a stabilizer STRUCTURE"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved 2 to 4 hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time for a wide range of dose levels are linear which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t\u00bd = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8- (8.5)]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial or cartridge prior to administration of the drug to a patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Heparin Sodium Injection, products must not be confused with \"catheter lock flush\" products. To lessen this risk for a cartridge, a red cautionary statement has been added to the cartridge and box/bin. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect With Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: 2.4 Pediatric Use Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous injection (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of Heparin Sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of Heparin Sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturer's recommendations are not available.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and sterile cartridges containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \"catheter lock flush\" vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm the correct product choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use Heparin Sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of Heparin Sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome\" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \"gasping syndrome\" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Local Irritation- Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of Heparin Sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions- Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity- Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Elevations of aminotransferases- Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Miscellaneous- Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of Heparin Sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin Sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when Heparin Sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving Heparin Sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of Heparin Sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of Heparin Sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \"catheter lock flush\" vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \"gasping syndrome\" occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin Units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structural formula of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Carpuject\u2122 sterile cartridge unit contain a sterile solution of Heparin Sodium Injection, USP. Each mL contains 5,000 USP Units of heparin sodium and benzyl alcohol 1% as a preservative, in Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted between 5.0 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Each mL of Preservative-Free Heparin Sodium Injection contains 10,000 USP Units in Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted between 5.0 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as required.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age. Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved two to four hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t1\u20442 = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Heparin is not intended for intramuscular use. Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Hypersensitivity). Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage. Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular\u2014Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical\u2014During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic\u2014Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal\u2014Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other\u2014Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. Coagulation Testing When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be regulated by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be promptly discontinued (see OVERDOSAGE ). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm3) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops (see Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis), the heparin product should be discontinued, and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered, if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) See WARNINGS. Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin. Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta, based on human and animal studies. Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Exercise caution when administering HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a nursing mother (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Pediatric Use). Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials (see WARNINGS , Fatal Medication Errors). Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women (see PRECAUTIONS , General). Clinical studies indicate that lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient\u2019s death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal. (c) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) and Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT See WARNINGS. Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. These complications are much more common after intramuscular use, and such use is not recommended. Hypersensitivity Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Certain episodes of painful, ischemic and cyanosed limbs have in the past been attributed to allergic vasospastic reactions. Whether these are in fact identical to the thrombocytopenia-associated complications, remains to be determined. Miscellaneous Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding. Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial prior to administration of the drug to a patient (see WARNINGS , Fatal Medication Errors). The 1 mL vial must not be confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of inappropriate strength. Confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every four hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn four to six hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time. This is about five hours after the last IV bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. If continuous IV heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time. In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering. Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants (see WARNINGS , Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism. The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for seven days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS ). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate are advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated. There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters. Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units/1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts. DOSAGE"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma. Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection single-dose and multiple-dose vials (contain 10.5 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Local irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions - Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hyperkalemia."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans possessing anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6\u2219sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is available in the following concentrations/mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol pH 5.0\u20137.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 0.01 mL 5,000 USP units 7 mg 0.01 mL 10,000 USP units 5 mg 0.01 mL Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* ( 2.3 ) * Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Use a different site for each injection. Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial or cartridge prior to administration of the drug to a patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Heparin Sodium Injection products must not be confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d products. To lessen this risk for a cartridge, a red cautionary statement has been added to the cartridge and box/bin. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous injection (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturer\u2019s recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and sterile cartridges containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm the correct product choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection cartridges in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection cartridges (Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/1 mL single-dose cartridge contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Local irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions - Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structural formula of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Carpuject\u2122 sterile cartridge unit contain a sterile solution of Heparin Sodium Injection, USP. Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/1 mL, single-dose cartridge, preserved with benzyl alcohol Each mL contains 5,000 USP units of heparin sodium and benzyl alcohol 1% as a preservative, in Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted between 5.0 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/0.5 mL, single-dose cartridge, preservative-free Each 0.5 mL of preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection contains 5,000 USP units in Water for Injection.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection, USP vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \"catheter lock flush\" vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \"Tear Here\" point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection, USP by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection, USP by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection, USP according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection, USP by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection, USP in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection, USP to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \"catheter lock flush\" vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome\" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \"gasping syndrome\" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Local irritation-Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions-Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity-Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Elevations of aminotransferases-Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin . Miscellaneous-Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection, USP vials have been confused with \"catheter lock flush\" vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \"gasping syndrome\" occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans possessing anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6\u2219sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is available in the following concentrations/mL: pH 5.0\u20137.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin\u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Heparin Sodium Injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ; Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (e.g., anaphylactoid reactions) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]; In whom suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin); An uncontrolled active bleeding state [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITTS) ( 4 ) Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products ( 4 ) In whom suitable blood coagulation tests cannot be performed at appropriate intervals ( 4 ) An uncontrolled bleeding state, except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 4 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. ( 5.2 ) HIT or HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. ( 5.3 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy; discontinue heparin in HIT or HITT is suspected. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life-threatening situations. ( 5.5 ) Heparin Resistance: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. ( 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.7 ) Elevations of serum aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. ( 5.8 ) Laboratory Tests: Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy regardless of the route of administration. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving HEPARIN SODIUM. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HITT. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin\u2013naive individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because Heparin Sodium in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with anti-thrombin deficiency. Consider measurement of anti-thrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.7 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.8 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions are: hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT or HITT, hypersensitivity reactions, heparin resistance, hyperkalemia, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact B. Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-227-2862 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Vascular Disorders \u2013 Contusion, Vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases, and Thrombocytopenia \u2013 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and 5.4) ] Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders \u2013 Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \u2013 Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women. ( 5.2 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses, approximately 2777 times the recommended human dose (MRHD) for maintenance of catheter patency of heparin [ see Data ] . In pregnant animals, doses up to 2777 times higher than the human daily dose of heparin resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 2777 times the human daily dose. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HEPARIN SODIUM IN 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogenous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of alpha-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate (1), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-alpha-D-glucose 6-sulfate (2), beta-D-glucuronic acid (3), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose (4), and alpha-L-iduronic acid (5). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is a sterile, single-dose, clear, nonpyrogenic solution prepared from Heparin Sodium USP (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa and standardized for use as an anticoagulant) in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. It is to be administered by intravenous injection. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Each 100 mL contains 200 USP Units Heparin Sodium, 0.43 g Dibasic Sodium Phosphate\u20227H 2 O USP and 0.037 g Citric Acid Anhydrous USP as a buffer system, 0.9 g Sodium Chloride USP, and Water for Injection USP qs. pH: 7.0 (6.8-7.2); Calculated Osmolarity: 360 mOsmol/liter Concentration of Electrolytes (mEq/liter): Sodium 186; Chloride 154; Phosphate (HPO ) 32; Citrate 6 The plastic container is made from a multilayered film specifically developed for parenteral drugs. It contains no plasticizers and exhibits virtually no leachables. The solution contact layer is a rubberized copolymer of ethylene and propylene. The container is nontoxic and biologically inert. The container-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration. The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary. The plastic container is not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP. The closure system has two ports; the one for the administration set has a tamper evident plastic protector. heparin sodium chemical formula Symbol"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patient with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.2 Instructions for Use of Prefilled Syringe CAUTION: Certain glass syringes may malfunction, break or clog when connected to some Needleless Luer Access Devices (NLADs) and needles. This syringe has a larger internal syringe tip and an external collar (luer collar). The external collar must remain attached to the syringe.

Remove the plastic tube cap of the outer packaging to access the syringe. 3. Remove the syringe from the plastic tube. 4. Perform visual inspection on the syringe by verifying: - absence of syringe damage - absence of external particles - absence of internal particles - proper drug color - expiration date to be sure that the drug has not expired - drug name - drug strength - dose volume - route of administration - sterile field applicability 5. Push plunger rod slightly to break the stopper loose while tip cap is still on. 6. Remove tip cap by twisting it off. (See Figure 2) Figure 2 7. Discard the tip cap. 8. Expel air bubble. 9. Adjust dose by expelling extra volume (where applicable) from the syringe into sterile material prior to administration. 10. Connect the syringe to appropriate injection connection depending on route of administration. Before injection, ensure that the syringe is securely attached to the needle or needleless luer access device (NLAD). 11. Depress plunger rod to deliver medication. Ensure that pressure is maintained on the plunger rod during the entire administration. 12. Remove syringe from NLAD (if applicable) and discard into appropriate receptacle. To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped. NOTES: - All steps must be done sequentially - Do not autoclave syringe - Do not use this product on a sterile field - Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time - This product is for single dose only; discard unused portion CSFW 2 - corrected smaller from Word Figure 2 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available.",
      "2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ].",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and syringes containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm the correct vial or syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Heparin Resistance [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [ see Data ]. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and syringes to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 68 kg patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 units to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP by intravenous injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 units/24 hours to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection syringe to ensure that the 1 mL syringe is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d syringe or other 1 mL syringe of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin sodium is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin sodium in the solution. Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts and hematocrits during the entire course of heparin sodium therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 68 kg patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours Or Every 12 hours 8,000 units to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 units to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP by intravenous injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 units to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 mL to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 units/24 hours to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.5 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin sodium by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 27-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.6 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin sodium therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin sodium therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin sodium, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin sodium injection was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available. 2.10 Administration Technique Figure 1: Outer Packaging and Prefilled Syringe NOTES: -Do not introduce any other fluid into the syringe at any time. -Do not dilute for intravenous push. -Do not re-sterilize the syringe. -Do not use this product on a sterile field. -This product is for single dose only.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin sodium Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin sodium ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in syringes containing a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL (5,000 units per 0.5 mL). Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection syringes to confirm the correct syringe choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin sodium in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin sodium therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin sodium. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin sodium is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin sodium dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin Sodium-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin Sodium-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin sodium-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin sodium and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin sodium-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin sodium, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin sodium therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin sodium has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin sodium therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin sodium therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin sodium, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin sodium therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.6 Heparin Sodium Resistance Resistance to heparin sodium is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin sodium doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin sodium should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.8 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin Sodium-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin Sodium-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Heparin Sodium Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin sodium therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin sodium therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin sodium therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin sodium, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin sodium. Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin sodium, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin sodium is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin sodium dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin sodium and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin sodium is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin sodium is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin sodium exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin sodium therapy is needed during pregnancy. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin sodium via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin sodium intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin sodium is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin sodium in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Pediatric dosing is not achievable with the prefilled syringe presentation. Use another heparin sodium product presentation when dosing pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin sodium. Lower doses of heparin sodium may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin sodium overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Sodium Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin sodium effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin sodium units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin sodium is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin sodium is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of protamine sulfate injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated O -sulfated O -sulfated or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin sodium activity per milligram. Each 0.5 mL of the 5,000 units per 0.5 mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP heparin sodium units (porcine); water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Structure of Heparin Sodium"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin sodium interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin sodium inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin sodium also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin sodium does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin sodium; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin sodium. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin sodium. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin sodium is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin sodium is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin sodium does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin sodium is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin sodium undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin sodium, may have higher plasma levels of heparin sodium and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the \u201cTear Here\u201d point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)]. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available. Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin(2.3) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient.

Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)]. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration (5.1) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage (5.2) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS (5.3) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use this product in neonates and infants. (5.4) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin (5.5, 5.6)"

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels.

      "USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data]. Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4)]. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. \u2022 Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. (8.1) \u2022 Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. (8.2) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. (8.4) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. (8.5) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION. Revised: 9/2019"

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of protamine sulfate injection."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-sulfated O-sulfated O-sulfated or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium, USP (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium, USP derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with benzyl alcohol is available in the following concentrations/mL: pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)]."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring.",
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion *Based on 68 kg patient 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to Weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers\u2019 recommendations are not available."

( 5.9 )",
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4\u00ad heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )\u200b] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life- threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported.

      "Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 )",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day (see Data) . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino- \u03b1 -D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2 -D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucose and (5) \u03b1 -L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin \u2020 ( 2.4 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary statement. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.3 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.4 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.5 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.6 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.7 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.8 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.9 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.10 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.11 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about \u00bd hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE for the freeflex\u00ae Bag Leave bag in the overwrap until time of use. The intact port cap provides visual tamper evidence. Do not use if port cap is prematurely removed. Maintain strict aseptic technique during handling. To Open: Always inspect the bag before and after removal from the overwrap. Place the bag on a clean, flat surface. Starting in the bottom corner, peel the overwrap open and remove the bag. Check the bag for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, discard the bag. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Prepare for Administration: Immediately before connecting the infusion set, firmly grasp the BLUE infusion port cap with the arrow pointing away from the bag between index finger and thumb. Gently break off the port cap. The membrane of the infusion port is sterile, and disinfection before initial use is not necessary if proper aseptic handling technique is followed. Use a non-vented infusion set or close the air-inlet on a vented set. The BLUE infusion port is compatible with spike systems produced according to ISO 8536-4, with an external spike diameter of 5.5 to 5.7 mm. Close the roller clamp of the infusion set. Hold the base of the BLUE infusion port and insert the spike by rotating your wrist slightly until the spike is fully inserted. The port membrane contains a self-sealing septum that helps prevent leakage after removing the spike. The infusion port is not intended to be spiked more than once. Hang from the hole at the top of the bag. For Single Use Only. Discard unused portion. Do not admix with other drugs. Do not use flexible container in series connections. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect * Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose: 75 to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring: Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available. DOSAGE"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving Heparin Sodium. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2013 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2013 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. \u2013 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 and 5.4 )]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 units/24 hours infusion (see Data). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding may result from heparin overdosage. Neutralization of heparin effect When circumstances (e.g., bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly, in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-sulfated O-sulfated O-sulfated or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection and Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection are sterile, nonpyrogenic solutions prepared from heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) for intravenous administration. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, is available as follows: Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 5,000 or 10,000 USP Units; sodium chloride, 0.45 g; edetate disodium, dihydrate, 0.0111 g added as a stabilizer and water for injection, q.s. Each liter contains the following electrolytes: Sodium 77 mEq and chloride 77 mEq; pH 5.0 to 7.5. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection, is available as follows: Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 5,000 or 10,000 USP Units; dextrose hydrous, 5 g; citric acid anhydrous, 51 mg and sodium citrate dihydrate, 334 mg added as buffers; and sodium metabisulfite, 20 mg added as an antioxidant. Each liter contains the following electrolytes: Sodium 39 mEq and citrate 42 mEq; pH 5.0 to 7.5. STRUCTURE"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Population Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Use a different site for each injection. Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial or cartridge prior to administration of the drug to a patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Heparin Sodium Injection products must not be confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d products. To lessen this risk for a cartridge, a red cautionary statement has been added to the cartridge and box/bin. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (Intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous injection (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) with a fine (25- to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 USP units to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturer\u2019s recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs in neonates and infants ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials and sterile cartridges containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm the correct product choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection cartridges in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection cartridges (Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/1 mL single-dose cartridge contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITT, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and precautions (5.2) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2022 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2022 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. \u2022 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. \u2022 Local irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions - Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hyperkalemia."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Heparin Sodium Injection use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structural formula of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Carpuject\u2122 sterile cartridge unit contain a sterile solution of Heparin Sodium Injection, USP. Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/1 mL, single-dose cartridge, preserved with benzyl alcohol Each mL contains 5,000 USP units of heparin sodium and benzyl alcohol 1% as a preservative, in Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted between 5.0 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Heparin Sodium Injection 5,000 USP units/0.5 mL, single-dose cartridge, preservative-free Each 0.5 mL of preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection contains 5,000 USP units in Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted between 5.0 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as required. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]."

(68 kg) patient. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels ( 2.5 ) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose \u2265 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures Extracorporeal Dialysis ( 2.8 ) Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. See full prescribing information for recommended pediatric dosage. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE for the free flex \u00ae Bag Leave bag in the overwrap until time of use. The intact port cap provides visual tamper evidence. Do not use if port cap is prematurely removed. Maintain strict aseptic technique during handling. To Open: Always inspect the bag before and after removal from the overwrap. Place the bag on a clean, flat surface. Starting in the bottom corner, peel the overwrap open and remove the bag. Check the bag for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, discard the bag. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Prepare for Administration: Immediately before connecting the infusion set, firmly grasp the BLUE infusion port cap with the arrow pointing away from the bag between index finger and thumb. Gently break off the port cap. The membrane of the infusion port is sterile, and disinfection before initial use is not necessary if proper aseptic handling technique is followed. Use a non-vented infusion set or close the air-inlet on a vented set. The BLUE infusion port is compatible with spike systems produced according to ISO 8536-4, with an external spike diameter of 5.5 to 5.7 mm. Close the roller clamp of the infusion set. Hold the base of the BLUE infusion port and insert the spike by rotating your wrist slightly until the spike is fully inserted. The port membrane contains a self-sealing septum that helps prevent leakage after removing the spike. The infusion port is not intended to be spiked more than once. Hang from the hole at the top of the bag. For Single Use Only. Discard unused portion. Do not admix with other drugs. Do not use flexible container in series connections. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose* Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units per 24 hours * Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose: 75 to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring: Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer\u2019s operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage. ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITT. ( 5.3 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving Heparin Sodium. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2014 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Hemorrhage \u2013 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: \u2013 Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. \u2013 Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. \u2013 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 and 5.4 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Elevations of serum aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 units/24 hours infusion (see Data). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection to a pregnant woman. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection or Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Neutralization of heparin effect When circumstances (e.g., bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido (N-sulfated O-sulfated O-sulfated or N-acetylated) and O-sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucoronic acid). Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection and Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection are sterile, nonpyrogenic solutions prepared from heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) for intravenous administration. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium in 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, is available as follows: Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 5,000 or 10,000 USP Units; sodium chloride, 0.45 g; edetate disodium, dihydrate, 0.0111 g added as a stabilizer and water for injection, q.s. Each liter contains the following electrolytes: Sodium 77 mEq and chloride 77 mEq; pH 5.0 to 7.5. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection, is available as follows: Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 5,000 or 10,000 USP Units; dextrose hydrous, 5 g; citric acid anhydrous, 51 mg and sodium citrate dihydrate, 334 mg added as buffers; and sodium metabisulfite, 20 mg added as an antioxidant.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Population Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 and 5.4 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin\u2020 ( 2.3 ) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .

Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Structure of Heparin Sodium Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with parabens, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s. Made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preservative free, is available as follows: Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; Water for Injection q.s. Made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5). Each 0.5 mL of the 5,000 units per 0.5 mL preparation contains: 5,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); Water for Injection q.s.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo . Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age. Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved two to four hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t 1\u20442 = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots."

      "WARNINGS Heparin is not intended for intramuscular use. Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypersensitivity ). Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage. Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular \u2014Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic \u2014Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal \u2014Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. Coagulation Testing When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be regulated by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be promptly discontinued (see OVERDOSAGE ). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops (see Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis ), the heparin product should be discontinued, and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered, if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT.",

      "PRECAUTIONS General Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) See WARNINGS . Heparin Resistance \u2014Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women \u2014A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants \u2014Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors \u2014Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet- aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions \u2014Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia \u2014Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin. Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta, based on human and animal studies. Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Exercise caution when administering HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a nursing mother (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric Use ). Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials (see WARNINGS, Fatal Medication Errors ). Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Geriatric Use A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women (see PRECAUTIONS, General ).

An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient\u2019s death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal.

      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding. Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of Heparin Effect \u2014When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial prior to administration of the drug to a patient (see WARNINGS, Fatal Medication Errors ). The 1 mL vial must not be confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of inappropriate strength. Confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every four hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn four to six hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time. This is about five hours after the last IV bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. If continuous IV heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time. In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering. Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE (based on 150 lb [68 kg] patient) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution or Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants (see WARNINGS, Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity and PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism. The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for seven days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS ). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate are advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated. There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters. Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units/1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample. Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin. Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts.",

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Injection \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use this product in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. \u2022 Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . \u2022 Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

      "DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2- sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP (porcine), preserved with parabens, is available as follows : Each mL of the 1,000 units per mL preparation contains: 1,000 USP Heparin units (porcine); 9 mg sodium chloride; 1.5 mg methylparaben; 0.15 mg propylparaben; Water for Injection q.s. Made isotonic with sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (5.0 to 7.5).

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo .Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age. Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved two to four hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations. Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes. Liver and the reticuloendothelial system are the sites of biotransformation. The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t 1\u20442 = 10 minutes) and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs. The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots."

Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Hypersensitivity ). Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage. Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular \u2014Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical \u2014During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic \u2014Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Gastrointestinal \u2014Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other \u2014Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. Coagulation Testing When heparin sodium is administered in therapeutic amounts, its dosage should be regulated by frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be promptly discontinued (see OVERDOSAGE ). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued. However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops (see Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis ), the heparin product should be discontinued and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered, if patients require continued anticoagulation. Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) See WARNINGS . Heparin Resistance\u2014 Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women\u2014 A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants\u2014 Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors\u2014 Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions\u2014 Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin . Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia \u2014Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin. Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta, based on human and animal studies. Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. Exercise caution when administering HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to a nursing mother (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Pediatric Use See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric Use . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric Use ).

      "Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants\u2014 Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least five hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. Platelet Inhibitors\u2014 Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. Other Interactions\u2014 Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium.

Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient\u2019s death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal. (c) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) and Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT See WARNINGS . Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium.

Easy bruising or petechial formations may precede frank bleeding. Treatment Neutralization of Heparin Effect\u2014 When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP products.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial prior to administration of the drug to a patient (see WARNINGS , Fatal Medication Errors ). The 1 mL vial must not be confused with a \u2018\u2018catheter lock flush\u2019\u2019 vial or other 1 mL vial of inappropriate strength. Confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every four hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn four to six hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time. This is about five hours after the last IV bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. If continuous IV heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time. In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering. Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE (based on 150 lb [68 kg] patient) Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by IV injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/ 24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion Pediatric Use Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. Geriatric Use Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism. The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for seven days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS ). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate are advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated. There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters. Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers\u2019 operating directions carefully. Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units/1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: \u2022 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin* ( 2.3 ) Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection Subsequent Doses 5,000 to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 Units every 24 hours in 1000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection *Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. \u2022 Cardiovascular Surgery ( 2.5 ) Intravascular via Total Body Perfusion Initial Dose Greater than or equal to 150 units/kg; adjust for longer procedures \u2022 Extracorporeal Dialysis ( 2.8 ) For pediatric dosing see section 2.4 of full prescribing information. Intravascular via Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. This product should be administered by intravenous infusion. Do not use Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Do not admix with other drugs. Discard unused portion. Do not use plastic containers in series connection. This product should not be infused under pressure. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact. To Open Tear outer wrap and remove solution container. (Use aseptic technique) 1. Close flow control clamp of administration set. 2. Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated. NOTE: See full directions on administration set carton. 4. Suspend container from hanger. 5. Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber. 6. Open flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp. 7. Attach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture. 8. Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp. Warning: Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient's coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect Method of Administration Frequency Recommended Dose Based on 150 lb. (68 kg) patient. Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 Units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection Subsequent Doses 5,000 to 10,000 Units every 4 to 6 hours, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 Units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 Units every 24 hours in 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection 2.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 units/kg to 100 units/kg (intravenous bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 units/kg/hour to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 units/kg/hour to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70. 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor for signs of bleeding and manage promptly. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT or HITT: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT or HITT. ( 5.3) \u2022 Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy; discontinue heparin if HIT or HITT is suspected. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Heparin Resistance: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Use in patients with prior reactions only in life-threatening situations. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hyperkalemia: Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases: Interpret elevation of these enzymes with caution. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin sodium. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular \u2014 Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical \u2014 During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. \u2022 Hematologic \u2014 Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2014 Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other \u2014 Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HITT. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Once HIT or HITT is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all heparin sources (including heparin flushes) and use an alternative anticoagulant. Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin, or platelet activation induced by heparin. Obtain platelet counts at baseline and periodically during heparin administration. A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT. Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin in heparin-na\u00efve individuals and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14. In contrast, \u201crapid onset\u201d HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., previous 3 months). Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage (10) ] . Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Consider measurement of anti-thrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations and also asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Because Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy to pork products. This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.8 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure plasma potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician. 5.9 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Elevation of these enzymes in patients receiving heparin should be interpreted with caution. These elevations typically resolve upon heparin discontinuation."

(6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \u2022 Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug [see Overdosage (10) ] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: - Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. - Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. - Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \u2022 Vascular Disorders \u2013 Contusion, vasospastic reactions (including episodes of painful, ischemic, and cyanosed limbs). \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases, and Thrombocytopenia - [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ] \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . \u2022 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders \u2013 Osteoporosis with long-term administration of heparin. \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Hyperkalemia. \u2022 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \u2013 Erythema, mild pain, ulceration. \u2022 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIv/IIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Medications that May Interfere with Heparin Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, or intravenous nitroglycerine may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40,000 USP units/24 hours infusion [see Data ] . In pregnant animals, doses up to 10 times higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions. Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection to a pregnant woman and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 USP units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients over 60 years of age, especially women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment. Symptoms Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, blood in urine or tarry stools may be the first signs or symptoms of a heparin overdose. In the event of symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion. Treatment Neutralization of heparin effect: When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10 minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin Units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection. Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported, protamine sulfate should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin. For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6\u2219sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose, and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)>(1)>(4)>(3)>(5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Structure of Heparin Sodium (representative subunits): Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2219 H 2 O, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. Intravenous solutions with heparin sodium (derived from porcine intestinal mucosa) are sterile, nonpyrogenic fluids for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains heparin sodium 5,000 or 10,000 USP Units; dextrose, hydrous 5 g; citric acid, anhydrous, 51 mg and sodium citrate, dihydrate 334 mg added as buffers; sodium metabisulfite 20 mg added as an antioxidant. Each liter contains electrolytes sodium and citrate in amounts as listed in HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Table. See Table for summary of contents and characteristics of this solution. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. The flexible plastic container is fabricated either from a specially formulated nonplasticized, thermoplastic co-polyester (CR3) or from a polyolefin film. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers. Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent, and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal and Hepatic Impairment The rate of clearance of unfractionated heparin may be decreased in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, following similar doses of heparin may have higher plasma levels of heparin compared with patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hemorrhage Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Adult Dosages: Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin Sodium Injection \u2020 ( 2.3 ) \u2020 Based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient. Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose Every 4 to 6 hours 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose Continuous 5,000 units by intravenous injection 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Use Do not use this product in neonates and infants. Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Maintenance Dose Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain APTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Blood Transfusion Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood. 2.8 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Do not use this product in neonates and infants. ( 5.4 ) Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy -The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials (contains 10.42 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Miscellaneous \u2013 Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. Limited human data in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: A higher incidence of bleeding reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/ day [see Data ] . Consider the benefits and risks of heparin sodium for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing heparin sodium to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, possessing anticoagulant properties. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivations of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated, O -sulfated, or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits): Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP preserved with Benzyl Alcohol is available in the following concentrations per mL: Heparin Sodium Sodium Chloride Benzyl Alcohol 1,000 USP units 8.6 mg 10.42 mg 5,000 USP units 7 mg 10.42 mg 10,000 USP units 5 mg 10.42 mg pH 5.0 to 7.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct Heparin Sodium Injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Administer Heparin Sodium Injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of Heparin Sodium Injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with Heparin Sodium Injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the development of hematoma Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from Heparin Sodium Injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Heparin Sodium Injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: \u2022 History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ; \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products (e.g., anaphylactoid reactions) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]; \u2022 In whom suitable blood coagulation tests, e.g., the whole blood clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, etc., cannot be performed at appropriate intervals (this contraindication refers to full-dose heparin; there is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin); \u2022 An uncontrolled active bleeding state [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. \u2022 History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITTS) ( 4 ) \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products ( 4 ) \u2022 In whom suitable blood coagulation tests cannot be performed at appropriate intervals ( 4 ) \u2022 An uncontrolled bleeding state, except when this is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 4 )"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) \u2022 HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants \u2022 Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use Heparin Sodium Injection as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. Heparin Sodium Injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL Heparin Sodium Injection vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: \u2022 Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. \u2022 Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. \u2022 Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. \u2022 Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy o The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). \u2022 Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. \u2022 Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Heparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: o Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. o Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. o Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \u2022 HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. \u2022 Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. \u2022 Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Preservative-free formulation recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of Heparin Sodium Injection in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Heparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Heparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .

Adjust dose based on laboratory monitoring. Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.1 Preparation for Administration Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate. When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous (IV) administration, invert the container at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution. Storage of prepared infusion solution should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection. Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration. 2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect *Based on 68 kg patient METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE Deep Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection Use a different site for each injection to prevent the Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously development of hematoma Every 8 hours or 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution Every 12 hours 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial Dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Continuous Intravenous Infusion Initial Dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion 2.4 Pediatric Dosing Use preservative-free heparin sodium injection in neonates and infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients: Recommended Pediatric Use Initial Dose 75 to 100 units/kg (IV bolus over 10 minutes) Maintenance Dose Infants: 25 to 30 units/kg/hour; Infants < 2 months have the highest requirements (average 28 units/kg/hour) Children > 1 year of age: 18 to 20 units/kg/hour; Older children may require less heparin, similar to weight-adjusted adult dosage Monitoring Adjust heparin to maintain aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds, assuming this reflects an anti-Factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes. 2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma. 2.7 Converting to Warfarin To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.8 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered. 2.9 Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium as a \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d product. heparin sodium is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium vials were confused with 1 mL \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage\u2212Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Local Irritation \u2013 Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions \u2013 Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity \u2013 Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases \u2013 Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that interfere with coagulation, platelet aggregation or drugs that counteract coagulation may induce bleeding ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) \u2013 The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human)."

( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on heparin sodium use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans. No teratogenicity, but early embryo-fetal death was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of heparin sodium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45,000 units/day ( see Data ). Consider the benefits and risks of Heparin Sodium Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Heparin Sodium Injection to a pregnant woman. If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy. There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The maternal and fetal outcomes associated with uses of heparin via various dosing methods and administration routes during pregnancy have been investigated in numerous studies. These studies generally reported normal deliveries with no maternal or fetal bleeding and no other complications. Animal Data In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight. The number of early resorptions increased in both species. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary If available, preservative-free heparin sodium is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation. Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. There is no information regarding the presence of heparin sodium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for heparin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from heparin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Carefully examine all heparin sodium vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug. Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which heparin sodium vials have been confused with \u201ccatheter lock flush\u201d vials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free heparin sodium in neonates and infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. 8.5 Geriatric Use There are limited adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older, however, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Neutralization of Heparin Effect When clinical circumstances (bleeding) require reversal of the heparin effect, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. No more than 50 mg should be administered, very slowly , in any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, it may, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, be assumed to have a half-life of about 1/2 hour after intravenous injection. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported with protamine, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Heparin is a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans, having anticoagulant properties. Although others may be present, the main sugars occurring in heparin are: (1) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid 2-sulfate, (2) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-\u03b1-D-glucose 6-sulfate, (3) \u00df-D-glucuronic acid, (4) 2- acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucose and (5) \u03b1-L-iduronic acid. These sugars are present in decreasing amounts, usually in the order (2)> (1)> (4)> (3)> (5), and are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes. Heparin is strongly acidic because of its content of covalently linked sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. In heparin sodium, the acidic protons of the sulfate units are partially replaced by sodium ions. Heparin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of heparin sodium derived from porcine intestinal mucosa, standardized for anticoagulant activity, in water for injection. It is to be administered by intravenous or deep subcutaneous routes. The potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h. Specific Populations Geriatric patients Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] ."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Prior to Surgery Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypersensitivity Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Other Medications Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] .
