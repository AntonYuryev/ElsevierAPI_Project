      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hydrate prior to and following Kyprolis as needed. ( 2.1 ) Premedicate prior to all Cycle 1 doses and if infusion-related reactions develop or reappear. ( 2.1 ) The recommended dosing regimens are as follows. See Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage information. ( 2.2 ) Regimen Dosage Infusion Time Kyprolis and Dexamethasone (Kd) or Kyprolis, Daratumumab and Dexamethasone (DKd) or Kyprolis, Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and Dexamethasone (DKd) 20/70 mg/m 2 once weekly 30 minutes Kyprolis and Dexamethasone (Kd) or Kyprolis, Daratumumab and Dexamethasone (DKd) or Kyprolis, Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and Dexamethasone (DKd) or Kyprolis, Isatuximab and Dexamethasone (Isa-Kd) or Kyprolis Monotherapy 20/56 mg/m 2 twice weekly 30 minutes Kyprolis, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (KRd) or Kyprolis Monotherapy 20/27 mg/m 2 twice weekly 10 minutes 2.1 Administration Precautions Hydration Adequate hydration is required prior to dosing in Cycle 1, especially in patients at high-risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) or renal toxicity. Consider hydration with both oral fluids (30 mL per kg at least 48 hours before Cycle 1, Day 1) and intravenous fluids (250 mL to 500 mL of appropriate intravenous fluid prior to each dose in Cycle 1). If needed, give an additional 250 mL to 500 mL of intravenous fluids following Kyprolis administration. Continue oral and/or intravenous hydration, as needed, in subsequent cycles. Monitor patients for evidence of volume overload and adjust hydration to individual patient needs, especially in patients with or at risk for cardiac failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ] . Electrolyte Monitoring Monitor serum potassium levels regularly during treatment with Kyprolis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Premedications and Concomitant Medications Premedicate with the recommended dose of dexamethasone for monotherapy or dexamethasone administered as part of the combination therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Administer dexamethasone orally or intravenously at least 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours prior to all doses of Kyprolis during Cycle 1 to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Reinstate dexamethasone premedication if these symptoms occur during subsequent cycles. Provide thromboprophylaxis for patients being treated with Kyprolis in combination with other therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Consider antiviral prophylaxis to decrease the risk of herpes zoster reactivation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Dose Calculation For patients with body surface area (BSA) of 2.2 m 2 or less, calculate the Kyprolis dose using actual BSA. Dose adjustments do not need to be made for weight changes of 20% or less.

The reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Read the complete preparation instructions prior to reconstitution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Reconstitution/Preparation Steps : Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use. Calculate the dose (mg/m 2 ) and number of vials of Kyprolis required using the patient's BSA at baseline. Aseptically reconstitute each Kyprolis vial only with Sterile Water for Injection, USP using the volumes described in Table 6. Use a 21-gauge or larger needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to reconstitute each vial by slowly injecting Sterile Water for Injection through the stopper and directing the Sterile Water for Injection onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimize foaming. There is no data to support the use of closed system transfer devices with Kyprolis. Table 6: Reconstitution Volumes Strength Amount of Sterile Water for Injection required for reconstitution 10 mg vial 5 mL 30 mg vial 15 mL 60 mg vial 29 mL Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for about 1 minute, or until complete dissolution. DO NOT SHAKE to avoid foam generation. If foaming occurs, allow the solution to settle in the vial until foaming subsides (approximately 5 minutes) and the solution is clear. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted product should be a clear, colorless solution and should not be administered if any discoloration or particulate matter is observed. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. DO NOT pool unused portions from the vials. DO NOT administer more than one dose from a vial. Administer Kyprolis directly by intravenous infusion or in a 50 mL to 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5% Dextrose Injection . Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. When administering in an intravenous bag, use a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute into 50 mL or 100 mL intravenous bag containing only 5% Dextrose Injection (based on the calculated total dose and infusion time). Flush the intravenous administration line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection immediately before and after Kyprolis administration. Do not mix Kyprolis with or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products. The stabilities of reconstituted Kyprolis under various temperature and container conditions are shown in Table 7.

( 2.1 , 5.9 ) Hemorrhage : Fatal or serious cases of hemorrhage may occur, including gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhage. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. ( 5.10 ) Thrombocytopenia : Monitor platelet counts; interrupt or reduce Kyprolis dosing as clinically indicated. ( 2.3 , 5.11 ) Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure : Monitor liver enzymes regularly. Withhold Kyprolis if suspected. ( 5.12 ) Thrombotic Microangiopathy : Monitor for signs and symptoms. Discontinue Kyprolis if suspected. ( 5.13 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) : Consider neuro-radiological imaging (MRI) for onset of visual or neurological symptoms; discontinue Kyprolis if suspected. ( 5.14 ) Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy : Consider PML if new or worsening neurologic manifestations. Discontinue Kyprolis in patients who develop PML. ( 5.15 ) Increased Fatal and Serious Toxicities in Combination with Melphalan and Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Ineligible Patients ( 5.16 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Kyprolis can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.17 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Cardiac Toxicities New onset or worsening of pre-existing cardiac failure (e.g., congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, decreased ejection fraction), cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction including fatalities have occurred following administration of Kyprolis. Some events occurred in patients with normal baseline ventricular function. In clinical studies with Kyprolis, these events occurred throughout the course of Kyprolis therapy. Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within one day of Kyprolis administration. In randomized, open-label, multicenter trials for combination therapies, the incidence of cardiac failure events was 8% and that of arrythmias was 8% (majority of which were atrial fibrillation and sinus tachycardia) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor patients for clinical signs or symptoms of cardiac failure or cardiac ischemia. Evaluate promptly if cardiac toxicity is suspected. Withhold Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4 cardiac adverse reactions until recovery and consider whether to restart Kyprolis at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . While adequate hydration is required prior to each dose in Cycle 1, monitor all patients for evidence of volume overload, especially patients at risk for cardiac failure. Adjust total fluid intake as clinically appropriate in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk for cardiac failure [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In patients \u2265 75 years of age, the risk of cardiac failure is increased compared to younger patients. Patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, conduction abnormalities, angina, or arrhythmias uncontrolled by medications were not eligible for the clinical trials. These patients may be at greater risk for cardiac complications; for these patients, complete a comprehensive medical assessment (including blood pressure control and fluid management) prior to starting treatment with Kyprolis and remain under close follow-up [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.2 Acute Renal Failure Cases of acute renal failure have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. Renal insufficiency (including renal failure) has occurred in approximately 9% of patients who received Kyprolis. Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received Kyprolis monotherapy. The risk of fatal renal failure was greater in patients with a baseline reduced estimated creatinine clearance (calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation). Monitor renal function with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.3 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of TLS, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Patients with multiple myeloma and a high tumor burden should be considered to be at greater risk for TLS. Administer oral and intravenous fluids before administration of Kyprolis in Cycle 1 and in subsequent cycles as needed. Consider uric acid-lowering drugs in patients at risk for TLS. Monitor for TLS during treatment and manage promptly, including interruption of Kyprolis until TLS is resolved [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure have occurred in approximately 2% of patients who received Kyprolis. In addition, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease, such as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease, occurred in approximately 2% of patients who received Kyprolis. Some events were fatal. In the event of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, discontinue Kyprolis. 5.5 Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension was reported in approximately 2% of patients who received Kyprolis, with Grade 3 or greater in less than 1%. Evaluate with cardiac imaging and/or other tests as indicated. Withhold Kyprolis for pulmonary hypertension until resolved or returned to baseline and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment. 5.6 Dyspnea Dyspnea was reported in 25% of patients treated with Kyprolis, with Grade 3 or greater in 4%. Evaluate dyspnea to exclude cardiopulmonary conditions including cardiac failure and pulmonary syndromes. Stop Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea until resolved or returned to baseline. Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.7 Hypertension Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency, has been observed with Kyprolis. In ASPIRE, the incidence of hypertension events was 17% in the KRd arm versus 9% in the Rd arm. In ENDEAVOR, the incidence of hypertension events was 34% in the Kd arm versus 11% in the Vd arm. In CANDOR, the incidence of hypertension events was 31% in the DKd arm versus 28% in the Kd arm. Some of these events have been fatal. Optimize blood pressure prior to starting Kyprolis. Monitor blood pressure regularly in all patients while on Kyprolis. If hypertension cannot be adequately controlled, withhold Kyprolis and evaluate. Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment. 5.8 Venous Thrombosis Venous thromboembolic events (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) have been observed with Kyprolis. In ASPIRE, with thromboprophylaxis used in both arms, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events in the first 12 cycles was 13% in the KRd arm versus 6% in the Rd arm. In ENDEAVOR, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events in months 1\u20136 was 9% in the Kd arm versus 2% in the Vd arm. With Kyprolis monotherapy, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events was 2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Provide thromboprophylaxis for patients being treated with Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone; with dexamethasone; or with intravenous daratumumab and dexamethasone. Select the thromboprophylaxis regimen based on the patient's underlying risks. For patients using oral contraceptives or hormonal contraception associated with a risk of thrombosis, consider non-hormonal contraception during treatment when Kyprolis is administered in combination [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions, including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis. Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial edema, laryngeal edema, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These reactions can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. Administer dexamethasone prior to Kyprolis to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion-related reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.10 Hemorrhage Fatal or serious cases of hemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with Kyprolis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Hemorrhagic events have included gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhage and epistaxis. The bleeding can be spontaneous and intracranial hemorrhage has occurred without trauma. Hemorrhage has been reported in patients having either low or normal platelet counts. Hemorrhage has also been reported in patients who were not on antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.11 Thrombocytopenia Kyprolis causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs observed between Day 8 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle, with recovery to baseline platelet count usually by the start of the next cycle [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Thrombocytopenia was reported in approximately 32% of patients in clinical trials with Kyprolis. Hemorrhage may occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Monitor platelet counts frequently during treatment with Kyprolis. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.12 Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported (2%) during treatment with Kyprolis. Kyprolis can cause increased serum transaminases [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor liver enzymes regularly, regardless of baseline values. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.13 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/ hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS. If the diagnosis is suspected, stop Kyprolis and evaluate. If the diagnosis of TTP/HUS is excluded, Kyprolis may be restarted. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing TTP/HUS is not known. 5.14 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in patients receiving Kyprolis. PRES, formerly termed Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), is a neurological disorder which can present with seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, altered consciousness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, along with hypertension, and the diagnosis is confirmed by neuro-radiological imaging (MRI). Discontinue Kyprolis if PRES is suspected and evaluate. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. 5.15 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which can be fatal, has been reported with Kyprolis. In addition to Kyprolis, other possible contributory factors include prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy that may cause immunosuppression. Consider PML in any patient with new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurological signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, discontinue Kyprolis and initiate evaluation for PML including neurology consultation. 5.16 Increased Fatal and Serious Toxicities in Combination with Melphalan and Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Ineligible Patients In CLARION, a clinical trial of 955 transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma randomized to Kyprolis (20/36 mg/m 2 by 30-minute infusion twice weekly for four of each six-week cycle), melphalan and prednisone (KMP) or bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP), a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions (7% versus 4%) and serious adverse reactions (50% versus 42%) were observed in the KMP arm compared to patients in the VMP arm, respectively. Patients in the KMP arm were observed to have a higher incidence of any grade adverse reactions involving cardiac failure (11% versus 4%), hypertension (25% versus 8%), acute renal failure (14% versus 6%), and dyspnea (18% versus 9%). This study did not meet its primary outcome measure of superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) for the KMP arm. Kyprolis in combination with melphalan and prednisone is not indicated for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Kyprolis can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Carfilzomib administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at a dose approximately 40% of the clinical dose of 27 mg/m 2 based on BSA caused post-implantation loss and a decrease in fetal weight. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] ."

The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to Kyprolis in 2,239 patients administered in combination with other drugs in ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR, A.R.R.O.W., CANDOR, IKEMA, EQUULEUS, and PLEIADES. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients who received Kyprolis in combination were anemia, diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, and insomnia. Kyprolis in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone The safety of Kyprolis 20/27 mg/m 2 twice weekly in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) was evaluated in ASPIRE [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median number of cycles initiated was 22 cycles for the KRd arm and 14 cycles for the Rd arm. Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of any therapy in the KRd arm occurred in 45/392 (12%) patients compared with 42/389 (11%) patients who died due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of any Rd therapy. The most frequent cause of deaths occurring in patients (%) in the two arms (KRd versus Rd) included infection 12 (3%) versus 11 (3%), cardiac 10 (3%) versus 9 (2%), and other adverse reactions 23 (6%) versus 22 (6%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of the patients in the KRd arm and 57% of the patients in the Rd arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in the KRd arm as compared with the Rd arm were pneumonia (17% versus 13%), respiratory tract infection (4% versus 2%), pyrexia (4% versus 3%), and pulmonary embolism (3% versus 2%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 33% in the KRd arm versus 30% in the Rd arm. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Kyprolis occurred in 12% of patients and the most common reactions included pneumonia (1%), myocardial infarction (0.8%), and upper respiratory tract infection (0.8%). The incidence of cardiac failure events was 7% in the KRd arm versus 4% in the Rd arm. Table 8 summarizes the adverse reactions in the first 12 cycles in ASPIRE.

ENDEAVOR The safety of Kyprolis 20/56 mg/m 2 twice weekly in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) was evaluated in ENDEAVOR [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients received treatment for a median duration of 48 weeks in the Kd arm and 27 weeks in the bortezomib/dexamethasone (Vd) arm. Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of last study treatment occurred in 32/463 (7%) patients in the Kd arm and 21/456 (5%) patients in the Vd arm. The causes of death occurring in patients (%) in the two arms (Kd versus Vd) included cardiac 4 (1%) versus 5 (1%), infections 8 (2%) versus 8 (2%), disease progression 7 (2%) versus 4 (1%), pulmonary 3 (1%) versus 2 (< 1%), renal 1 (< 1%) versus 0 (0%), and other adverse reactions 9 (2%) versus 2 (< 1%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 59% of the patients in the Kd arm and 40% of the patients in the Vd arm. In both arms, pneumonia was the most frequently reported serious adverse reaction (8% versus 9%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 29% in the Kd arm versus 26% in the Vd arm. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was cardiac failure in the Kd arm (n = 8, 2%) and peripheral neuropathy in the Vd arm (n = 22, 5%).

Premedication with dexamethasone 4 mg was required before each dose in Cycle 1 and was optional for subsequent cycles. The median age was 64 years (range 32\u201387), and approximately 57% were male. The patients received a median of 5 (range 1\u201320) prior regimens. The median number of cycles initiated was 4 (range 1\u201335). Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of Kyprolis occurred in 30/598 (5%) patients receiving Kyprolis monotherapy. These adverse reactions were related to cardiac disorders in 10 (2%) patients, infections in 8 (1%) patients, renal disorders in 4 (< 1%) patients, and other adverse reactions in 8 (1%) patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 50% of patients in the pooled Kyprolis monotherapy studies (N = 598). The most frequent serious adverse reactions were: pneumonia (8%), acute renal failure (5%), disease progression (4%), pyrexia (3%), hypercalcemia (3%), congestive heart failure (3%), multiple myeloma (3%), anemia (2%), and dyspnea (2%). In FOCUS, a randomized trial comparing Kyprolis as a single agent versus corticosteroids with optional oral cyclophosphamide for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, mortality was higher in the patients treated with Kyprolis in comparison to the control arm in the subgroup of 48 patients \u2265 75 years of age. The most common cause of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was acute renal failure (2%). Safety of Kyprolis monotherapy dosed at 20/56 mg/m 2 by 30-minute infusion was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label study in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The patients received a median of 4 (range 1\u201310) prior regimens. Adverse reactions occurring with Kyprolis monotherapy are presented in Table 19.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : In the Kyprolis clinical trials, the incidence of adverse reactions was greater in patients \u2265 75 years of age. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the dose of Kyprolis by 25% in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.4 ) Patients on Hemodialysis : Administer Kyprolis after the hemodialysis procedure. ( 2.1 ) Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Kyprolis can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data on Kyprolis use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risks. Kyprolis caused embryo-fetal lethality in rabbits at doses lower than the clinical dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%\u20134% and 15%\u201320%, respectively. Data Animal Data Carfilzomib administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day in rats and 0.8 mg/kg/day in rabbits. In rabbits, there was an increase in pre-implantation loss at \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day and an increase in early resorptions and post-implantation loss and a decrease in fetal weight at the maternally toxic dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day. The doses of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg/day in rabbits are approximately 20% and 40%, respectively, of the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m 2 based on BSA. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Kyprolis in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Kyprolis and for 2 weeks after treatment. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Kyprolis can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing on females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Kyprolis treatment. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 3 months following the last dose. Infertility Based on the mechanism of action, Kyprolis may have an effect on either male or female fertility [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . There are no data on the effect of Kyprolis on human fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Kyprolis in pediatric patients have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Kyprolis in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated, but not established in an open label trial (Study 20140106; NCT02303821) in 124 patients aged 1 to younger than 17 years with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have received prior targeted B-cell immune therapy or relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL. No new safety signals were observed in these pediatric patients. The systemic exposure of carfilzomib in these pediatric patients was within range of that observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,837 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma exposed to Kyprolis in monotherapy and combination therapy studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 , 14.4 , 14.5) ] , 50% were 65 years and older, while 13% were 75 years and older. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 50% in patients < 65 years of age, 60% in patients 65 to 74 years of age, and 63% in patients \u2265 75 years of age. Of the 308 patients in CANDOR who received DKd, 47% of patients were 65 years and older, while 9% were 75 years and older. Fatal adverse reactions in the DKd arm of CANDOR occurred in 6% of patients < 65 years of age, 14% of patients between 65 to 74 years of age, and 14% of patients \u2265 75 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between older and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Reduce the dose of Kyprolis by 25% in patients with mild (total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST or total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN) or moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A recommended dosage of Kyprolis has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment combined (22/35 or 63%) than in patients with normal hepatic function (3/11 or 27%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that irreversibly binds to the N-terminal threonine-containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle within the 26S proteasome. Carfilzomib had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in vitro in solid and hematologic tumor cells. In animals, carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumor growth in models of multiple myeloma, hematologic, and solid tumors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Intravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose. Doses of carfilzomib \u2265 15 mg/m 2 with or without lenalidomide and dexamethasone induced a \u2265 80% inhibition of the CT-L activity of the proteasome. In addition, carfilzomib, 20 mg/m 2 intravenously as a single agent, resulted in a mean inhibition of the low molecular mass polypeptide 2 (LMP2) and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1 (MECL1) subunits of the proteasome ranging from 26% to 32% and 41% to 49%, respectively. Proteasome inhibition was maintained for \u2265 48 hours following the first dose of carfilzomib for each week of dosing. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Carfilzomib at doses between 20 mg/m 2 and 70 mg/m 2 administered as a 30-minute infusion resulted in dose-dependent increases in maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC 0-INF ) in patients with multiple myeloma. A dose-dependent increase in C max and AUC 0-INF was also observed between carfilzomib 20 mg/m 2 and 56 mg/m 2 as a 2- to 10-minute infusion in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. A 30-minute infusion resulted in a similar AUC 0-INF , but 2- to 3-fold lower C max than that observed with a 2- to 10-minute infusion at the same dose. There was no evidence of carfilzomib accumulation following repeated administration of carfilzomib 70 mg/m 2 as a 30-minute once weekly infusion or 15 and 20 mg/m 2 as a 2- to 10-minute twice weekly infusion. Table 21 lists the estimated mean average daily area under the curve in the first cycle (AUC C1,avg ), average daily area under the curve at steady-state (AUC ss ) and C max at the highest dose in the first cycle (C max,C1 ) for the different dosing regimens.

Carfilzomib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins over the concentration range of 0.4 to 4 micromolar in vitro. Elimination Carfilzomib has a half-life of \u2264 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1 following intravenous doses \u2265 15 mg/m 2 . The half-life was similar when administered either as a 30-minute infusion or a 2- to 10-minute infusion. The systemic clearance ranged from 151 to 263 L/hour. Metabolism Carfilzomib is rapidly metabolized. Peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the principal pathways of metabolism. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated mechanisms contribute a minor role in overall carfilzomib metabolism. Excretion Approximately 25% of the administered dose of carfilzomib was excreted in urine as metabolites in 24 hours. Urinary and fecal excretion of the parent compound was negligible (0.3% of total dose). Specific Populations Age (35-89 years), sex, race or ethnicity (80% White, 11% Black, 6% Asians, 3% Hispanics), and mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-89 mL/min) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Compared to patients with normal hepatic function, patients with mild (total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST or total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN) and moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment had approximately 50% higher carfilzomib AUC. The pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST). Patients with Renal Impairment Relative to patients with normal renal function, ESRD patients on hemodialysis showed 33% higher carfilzomib AUC. Since hemodialysis clearance of Kyprolis concentrations has not been studied, the drug should be administered after the hemodialysis procedure. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Carfilzomib on Sensitive CYP3A Substrate: Midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) pharmacokinetics was not affected by concomitant administration of carfilzomib. In Vitro Studies Effect of Carfilzomib on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Carfilzomib showed direct and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A but did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Effect of Transporters on Carfilzomib: Carfilzomib is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate in vitro. Effect of Carfilzomib on Transporters: Carfilzomib inhibits P-gp in vitro. However, given that Kyprolis is administered intravenously and is extensively metabolized, the pharmacokinetics of Kyprolis is unlikely to be affected by P-gp inhibitors or inducers."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 In Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma ASPIRE (NCT01080391) ASPIRE was a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 lines of therapy (A line of therapy is a planned course of treatment [including sequential induction, transplantation, consolidation, and/or maintenance] without an interruption for lack of efficacy, such as for relapse or progressive disease). Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial: refractory to bortezomib in the most recent regimen, refractory to lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the most recent regimen, not responding to any prior regimen, creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, ALT/AST > 3.5 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN, New York Heart Association Class III to IV congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the last 4 months. In the KRd arm, Kyprolis was evaluated at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 , which was increased to 27 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 onward. Kyprolis was administered as a 10-minute infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle for Cycle 1 through 12. Kyprolis was dosed on Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle from Cycle 13 through 18. Dexamethasone 40 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Lenalidomide was given 25 mg orally on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. The Rd treatment arm had the same regimen for lenalidomide and dexamethasone as the KRd treatment arm. Kyprolis was administered for a maximum of 18 cycles unless discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone administration could continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Concurrent use of thromboprophylaxis and a proton pump inhibitor were required for both arms and antiviral prophylaxis was required for the KRd arm. The 792 patients in ASPIRE were randomized 1:1 to the KRd or Rd arm. The demographics and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two arms (see Table 22 ). Only 53% of the patients had testing for genetic mutations; a high-risk genetic mutation was identified for 12% of patients in the KRd arm and in 13% in the Rd arm.

ENDEAVOR (NCT01568866) ENDEAVOR was a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of Kyprolis and dexamethasone (Kd) versus bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 lines of therapy. A total of 929 patients were enrolled and randomized (464 in the Kd arm; 465 in the Vd arm). Randomization was stratified by prior proteasome inhibitor therapy (yes versus no), prior lines of therapy (1 versus 2 or 3), current International Staging System stage (1 versus 2 or 3), and planned route of bortezomib administration. Patients were excluded if they had less than PR to all prior regimens; creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min; hepatic transaminases \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN; or left-ventricular ejection fraction < 40% or other significant cardiac conditions. This trial evaluated Kyprolis at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 , which was increased to 56 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 onward. Kyprolis was administered twice weekly as a 30-minute infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of each cycle. In the Vd arm, bortezomib was dosed at 1.3 mg/m 2 intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle, and dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each cycle. Concurrent use of thromboprophylaxis was optional, and prophylaxis with an antiviral agent and proton pump inhibitor was required. Of the 465 patients in the Vd arm, 381 received bortezomib subcutaneously. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The median time to response was 1 month (range < 1 to 8 months) in both arms. Figure 3 Figure 4 A.R.R.O.W. (NCT02412878) A.R.R.O.W. was a randomized, open-label, multicenter superiority trial of Kyprolis and dexamethasone (Kd) once weekly (20/70 mg/m 2 ) versus Kd twice weekly (20/27 mg/m 2 ) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy. Patients were excluded if they had less than PR to at least one prior line; creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; hepatic transaminases \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN; or left-ventricular ejection fraction < 40% or other significant cardiac conditions. A total of 478 patients were enrolled and randomized (240 in 20/70 mg/m 2 arm; 238 in 20/27 mg/m 2 arm). Randomization was stratified by current International Staging System stage (stage 1 versus stages 2 or 3), refractory to bortezomib treatment (yes versus no), and age (< 65 versus \u2265 65 years). Arm 1 of this trial evaluated Kyprolis at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 , which was increased to 70 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 onward. Arm 1 Kyprolis was administered once weekly as a 30-minute infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15, of each 28-day cycle. Arm 2 of this trial evaluated Kyprolis at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 , which was increased to 27 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 onward. Arm 2 Kyprolis was administered twice weekly as a 10-minute infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle. In both regimens, dexamethasone 40 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 8, 15 for all cycles and on Day 22 for cycles 1 to 9 only. Concurrent use of thromboprophylaxis was optional, prophylaxis with an antiviral agent was recommended, and prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor was required. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 26.

The median time to response was 1.1 months in the Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm and 1.9 months in the Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm. Kyprolis is not approved for twice weekly 20/27 mg/m 2 administration in combination with dexamethasone alone. Figure 5 14.3 In Combination with Daratumumab and Dexamethasone for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma The efficacy of Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone or daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone (DKd) was evaluated in three open-label clinical trials (CANDOR, EQUULEUS, and PLEIADES). CANDOR (NCT03158688) CANDOR was a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis 20/56 mg/m 2 twice weekly with intravenous daratumumab and dexamethasone (DKd) versus Kyprolis 20/56 mg/m 2 twice weekly and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial: known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a FEV1 < 50% of predicted normal, and active congestive heart failure. Randomization was stratified by the ISS (stage 1 or 2 vs stage 3) at screening, prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes vs no), number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs \u2265 2), or prior cluster differentiation antigen 38 (CD38) antibody therapy (yes vs no). Kyprolis was administered intravenously over 30 minutes at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2; at a dose of 56 mg/m 2 in Cycle 1 on Days 8, 9, 15 and 16; and on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of each 28-day cycle thereafter. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 and then 40 mg orally or intravenously on Day 22 of each 28-day cycle. In the DKd arm, daratumumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2. Thereafter, daratumumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg/kg on Days 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1; Days 1, 8 and 15 and 22 of Cycle 2; Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 3 to 6; and Day 1 for the remaining cycles or until disease progression. For patients >75 years on a reduced dexamethasone dose of 20 mg, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a daratumumab pre-infusion medication on days when daratumumab was administered. Dosing of dexamethasone was otherwise split across days when Kyprolis was administered in both study arms. Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 466 patients were randomized; 312 to the DKd arm and 154 to the Kd arm. The demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 28.

Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial: known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a FEV1 < 50% of predicted normal, or active congestive heart failure (defined as New York Heart Association Class III-IV). Kyprolis was administered intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and escalated to a dose of 70 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1, Days 8 and 15; and on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Ten patients were administered daratumumab at a dose of 16 mg/kg intravenously on Cycle 1, Day 1 and the remaining patients were administered daratumumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg intravenously on Cycle 1, Days 1 and 2. Thereafter, daratumumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg/kg on Days 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1; Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 2; Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 3 to 6; and then Day 1 for the remaining cycles of each 28-day cycle. In Cycles 1 and 2, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23; in cycles 3 to 6, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 15 and 16 and at a dose of 40 mg on Day 8 and 22; and in cycles 7 and thereafter, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 and 2 and at a dose of 40 mg on Days 8, 15, and 22. For patients > 75 years of age, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously weekly after the first week. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

This cohort enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma excluding patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%, myocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >159 mmHg or diastolic >99 mmHg despite optimal treatment). Patients received Kyprolis administered by IV infusion at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and if a dose of 20 mg/m 2 was tolerated Kyprolis was administered at a dose of 70 mg/m 2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Day 15, and then Day 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle; daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj1,800 mg/30,000 units administered subcutaneously once weekly from Weeks 1 to 8, once every 2 weeks from Weeks 9 to 24 and once every 4 weeks starting with Week 25 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; and dexamethasone 40 mg per week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg per week for patients \u226575 years or BMI <18.5). The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR. A total of 66 patients received the DKd regimen. The median age was 61 years (range: 42, 84); 52% were male; 73% were White and 3% Black or African American; and 68% had ISS Stage I, 18% had ISS Stage II, and 14% had ISS Stage III disease. A total of 79% of patients had a prior ASCT; 91% of patients received a prior PI. All patients received 1 prior line of therapy with exposure to lenalidomide and 62% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 32. At a median follow-up of 9.2 months, the median duration of response had not been reached and an estimated 85.2% (95% CI: 72.5, 92.3) maintained response for at least 6 months and 82.5% (95% CI: 68.9, 90.6) maintained response for at least 9 months.

Patients had received one to three prior lines of therapy. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had an ECOG status of 0-2, platelets \u226550,000 cells/mm 3 , absolute neutrophil count \u22651 \u00d7 10 9 /L, creatinine clearance \u226515 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (MDRD formula), AST \u22643 \u00d7 ULN, and ALT \u22643 \u00d7 ULN. A total of 302 patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive either Kyprolis in combination with isatuximab and dexamethasone (Isa-Kd, 179 patients) or Kyprolis and dexamethasone (Kd, 123 patients). Treatment was administered in both groups in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Isatuximab 10 mg/kg was administered as an intravenous infusion weekly in the first cycle and every two weeks thereafter. Kyprolis was administered as an intravenous infusion at the dose of 20 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2; 56 mg/m 2 on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of cycle 1; and at the dose of 56 mg/m 2 on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 for subsequent cycles of each 28-day cycle. Dexamethasone (intravenously on the days of isatuximab and/or Kyprolis infusions, and orally on the other days) 20 mg was given on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 for each 28-day cycle. On the days where both Kyprolis and isatuximab were administered, dexamethasone was administered first, followed by isatuximab infusion, then followed by Kyprolis infusion. Overall, demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the two treatment groups. The median patient age was 64 years (range 33-90), 9% of patients were \u2265 75 years, 71% were White, 17% Asian, and 3% Black or African American. The proportion of patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) was 24% in the Isa-Kd group versus 15% in the Kd group. The International Staging System (ISS) stage at study entry was I in 53%, II in 31%, and III in 15% of patients. Overall, 24% of patients had high-risk chromosomal abnormalities at study entry; del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16) were present in 11%, 14%, and 2% of patients, respectively. In addition, gain(1q21) was present in 42% of patients. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-4) with 44% of patients who received 1 prior line of therapy. Overall, 90% of patients received prior proteasome inhibitors, 78% received prior immunomodulators (including 43% who received prior lenalidomide), and 61% received prior stem cell transplantation. Overall, 33% of patients were refractory to prior proteasome inhibitors, 45% were refractory to prior immunomodulators (including 33% refractory to lenalidomide), and 21% were refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator. The median duration of treatment was 80 weeks for the Isa-Kd group compared to 61 weeks for the Kd group. Efficacy was based upon PFS. PFS results were assessed by an Independent Response Committee based on central laboratory data for M-protein and central radiologic imaging review using the IMWG criteria. The improvement in PFS represented a 45% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with Isa-Kd compared to patients treated with Kd. Efficacy results are presented in Table 33. Table 33 Results are based on a prespecified interim analysis.

Patients were excluded if they had a creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min; ALT \u2265 3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 ULN; New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure; or other significant cardiac conditions. A total of 24 subjects with multiple myeloma were enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose level of 20/56 mg/m 2 . Kyprolis was administered twice weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) of a 28-day cycle. In Cycle 13 onward, the Day 8 and 9 Kyprolis doses could be omitted. Patients received Kyprolis at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1, which was increased to 56 mg/m 2 for all subsequent doses. Dexamethasone 8 mg orally or intravenously was required prior to each Kyprolis dose in Cycle 1 and was optional in subsequent cycles. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was evaluated by ORR and DOR. ORR by investigator assessment was 50% (95% CI: 29, 71) per IMWG criteria (see Table 34 ). The median DOR in subjects who achieved a PR or better was 8.0 months (Range: 1.4, 32.5).

Eligible patients were those with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies (including bortezomib and thalidomide and/or lenalidomide) and had \u2264 25% response to the most recent therapy or had disease progression during or within 60 days of the most recent therapy. Patients were excluded from the trial if they were refractory to all prior therapies or had a total bilirubin \u2265 2 \u00d7 ULN; creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; New York Heart Association Class III to IV congestive heart failure; symptomatic cardiac ischemia; myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 or 4, or peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 with pain; active infections requiring treatment; or pleural effusion. Kyprolis was administered intravenously up to 10 minutes on two consecutive days each week for three weeks, followed by a 12-day rest period (28-day treatment cycle), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 12 cycles. Patients received 20 mg/m 2 at each dose in Cycle 1, and 27 mg/m 2 in subsequent cycles. Dexamethasone 4 mg orally or intravenously was administered prior to Kyprolis doses in the first and second cycles. A total of 266 patients were enrolled.
