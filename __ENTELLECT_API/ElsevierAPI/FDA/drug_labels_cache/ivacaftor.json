      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elevated transaminases (ALT or AST): Transaminases (ALT and AST) should be assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. In patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Interrupt dosing in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing. ( 5.1 , 6 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis has been reported with KALYDECO in the postmarketing setting. Initiate appropriate therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.2 ) Intracranial hypertension : Intracranial hypertension (IH) has been reported in the postmarketing setting with use of drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as KALYDECO. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt KALYDECO and refer for prompt medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) substantially decreases exposure of ivacaftor, which may diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. ( 5.4 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Transaminase (ALT or AST) Elevations Elevated transaminases have been reported in patients with CF receiving KALYDECO. ALT and AST should be assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations, consider more frequent monitoring of liver function tests. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of anaphylaxis, have been reported in the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue KALYDECO and institute appropriate therapy. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with KALYDECO . 5.3 Intracranial Hypertension Cases of intracranial hypertension (IH) have been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as KALYDECO [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and potential vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt KALYDECO and refer for prompt medical evaluation. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with KALYDECO. Patients should be monitored until IH resolution and for recurrence. Patients with elevated vitamin A levels may be at increased risk. 5.4 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Use of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, substantially decreases the exposure of ivacaftor, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of KALYDECO. Therefore, co-administration of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and/or exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to KALYDECO cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Transaminase Elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to KALYDECO (\u22658% of patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene) were headache, oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, rash, nausea, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The overall safety profile of KALYDECO is based on pooled data from three placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted in 353 patients 6 years of age and older with CF who had a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene (Trials 1 and 2) or were homozygous for the F508del mutation (Trial 3). In addition, the following clinical trials have also been conducted [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Clinical Studies (14) ]: An 8-week, crossover design trial (Trial 4) involving 39 patients between the ages of 6 and 57 years with a G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , G970R , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene. A 24-week, placebo-controlled trial (Trial 5) involving 69 patients between the ages of 6 and 68 years with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. A 24-week, open-label trial (Trial 6) in 34 patients 2 to less than 6 years of age. Patients eligible for Trial 6 were those with the G551D, G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , G970R , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene. Of 34 patients enrolled, 32 had the G551D mutation and 2 had the S549N mutation. An 8-week, crossover design trial (Trial 7) involving patients between the ages of 12 and 72 years who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second CFTR mutation predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor. A total of 156 patients were randomized to and received KALYDECO. A 24-week open-label clinical trial in patients with CF aged less than 24 months (Trial 8) including a cohort of 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months, a cohort of 11 patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months, a cohort of 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months, and a cohort of 7 patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months. Patients with a gating mutation or R117H mutation were eligible for the first three cohorts of this study. Patients with any ivacaftor-responsive mutation were eligible for the cohort aged 1 to less than 4 months. Of the 353 patients included in the pooled analyses of patients with CF who had either a G551D mutation or were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, 50% of patients were female and 97% were Caucasian; 221 received KALYDECO, and 132 received placebo for 16 to 48 weeks. The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to adverse reactions was 2% for KALYDECO-treated patients and 5% for placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in KALYDECO-treated patients, included abdominal pain, increased hepatic enzymes, and hypoglycemia. The most common adverse reactions in the 221 patients treated with KALYDECO were headache (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (16%), nasal congestion (16%), nausea (10%), rash (10%), rhinitis (6%), dizziness (5%), arthralgia (5%), and bacteria in sputum (5%). The incidence of adverse reactions below is based upon two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in a total of 213 patients with CF ages 6 to 53 who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene and who were treated with KALYDECO 150 mg orally or placebo twice daily. Table 2 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u22658% of KALYDECO-treated patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Table 2: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in \u22658% of KALYDECO-Treated Patients with a G551D Mutation in the CFTR Gene and Greater than Placebo in 2 Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Clinical Trials of 48 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Incidence: Pooled 48-Week Trials KALYDECO N=109 n (%) Placebo N=104 n (%) Headache 26 (24) 17 (16) Oropharyngeal pain 24 (22) 19 (18) Upper respiratory tract infection 24 (22) 14 (14) Nasal congestion 22 (20) 16 (15) Abdominal pain 17 (16) 13 (13) Nasopharyngitis 16 (15) 12 (12) Diarrhea 14 (13) 10 (10) Rash 14 (13) 7 (7) Nausea 13 (12) 11 (11) Dizziness 10 (9) 1 (1) Adverse reactions in the 48-week clinical trials that occurred in the KALYDECO group at a frequency of 4 to 7% where rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Infections and infestations : rhinitis Investigations: aspartate aminotransferase increased, bacteria in sputum, blood glucose increased, hepatic enzyme increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia Nervous system disorders: sinus headache Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pharyngeal erythema, pleuritic pain, sinus congestion, wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: acne The safety profile for the CF patients enrolled in the other clinical trials (Trials 3-8) was similar to that observed in the 48-week, placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Laboratory Abnormalities Transaminase Elevations: In Trials 1, 2, and 3 the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 \u00d7 ULN was 2%, 2%, and 6% in KALYDECO-treated patients and 2%, 2%, and 8% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two patients (2%) on placebo and 1 patient (0.5%) on KALYDECO permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases, all >8 \u00d7 ULN. Two patients treated with KALYDECO were reported to have serious adverse reactions of elevated liver transaminases compared to none on placebo. Transaminase elevations were more common in patients with a history of transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years (Trial 6), where patients received either 50 mg (less than 14 kg) or 75 mg (14 kg or greater) ivacaftor granules twice daily, the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 \u00d7 ULN was 14.7% (5/34). All 5 patients had maximum ALT or AST levels >8 \u00d7 ULN, which returned to baseline levels following interruption of KALYDECO dosing. Transaminase elevations were more common in patients who had abnormal transaminases at baseline. KALYDECO was permanently discontinued in one patient [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in patients aged less than 24 months (Trial 8), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3, >5, and >8 \u00d7 ULN in the cohort of patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (N=19) was 27.8% (5/18), 11.1% (2/18) and 11.1% (2/18), respectively. In the cohort of patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months (N=11) one patient (9.1%) had elevated ALT of >3 to \u22645 \u00d7 ULN. In the cohort of patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (N=6), no patients had elevated ALT or AST (>3\u00d7 ULN). In the cohort of patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months (N=7), 1 patient (14.3%) had maximum ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN (ALT >8 \u00d7 ULN and AST of >3 to \u22645 \u00d7 ULN); the patient discontinued ivacaftor treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Postmarketing Adverse Reactions with KALYDECO The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of KALYDECO.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential for other drugs to affect ivacaftor CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce KALYDECO dosage in patients aged 6 months and older when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole). KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Inhibitors of CYP3A Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, significantly increased ivacaftor exposure [measured as area under the curve (AUC)] by 8.5-fold. Based on simulations of these results, a reduction of the KALYDECO dosage is recommended for patients aged 6 months and older taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin. KALYDECO is not recommended for patients less than 6 months of age taking strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the KALYDECO dosage is recommended for patients aged 6 months and older taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and erythromycin. KALYDECO is not recommended for patients less than 6 months of age taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of KALYDECO with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, avoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment with KALYDECO [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Inducers of CYP3A Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 9-fold. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Ciprofloxacin Co-administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin had no effect on the exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Potential for ivacaftor to affect other drugs 7.4 CYP2C9 Substrates Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during co-administration of KALYDECO with warfarin is recommended. Other therapeutic products for which exposure may be increased by KALYDECO include glimepiride and glipizide; these therapeutic products should be used with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 CYP3A and/or P-gp Substrates Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration with oral midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of KALYDECO may increase systemic exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A and/or P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Therefore, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when co-administering KALYDECO with sensitive CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports on use of KALYDECO in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse effects on fetal development at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 5 (rats) and 11 (rabbits) times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 3 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20% in clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-17. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (3 and 5 times the exposure at the MRHD) and was associated with a decrease in fetal body weights at a maternal dose of 200 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-19. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 11 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., death, decreased food consumption, decreased mean body weight and body weight gain, decreased clinical condition, abortions) was observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD). In a pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant female rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20. Ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ivacaftor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ivacaftor is excreted into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal lactation data may not reliably predict levels in human milk ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for KALYDECO, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KALYDECO or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating mothers (dams). Exposure (AUC 0-24h ) values for ivacaftor in milk were approximately 1.5 times higher than plasma levels. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KALYDECO for the treatment of CF have been established in pediatric patients 1 month to 17 years of age who have at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor potentiation based on clinical and/or in vitro assay data [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. The use of KALYDECO for this indication is supported by evidence from placebo-controlled clinical trials in the following pediatric patients with CF: 12 to 17 years of age who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 6 to 17 years of age with a G551D , G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , S549R, or R117H mutation in the CFTR gene [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . The effectiveness of KALYDECO in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years was extrapolated from patients 6 years of age and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar drug exposure levels in adults and pediatric patients 2 to less than 6 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety of KALYDECO in this population was derived from a 24-week, open-label clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years (mean age 3 years) administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor granules twice daily (Trial 6). The type and frequency of adverse reactions in this trial were similar to those in patients aged 6 years and older. Transaminase elevations were more common in patients who had abnormal transaminases at baseline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The effectiveness of KALYDECO in patients aged 1 month to less than 24 months was extrapolated from patients 6 years of age and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing that the exposure of ivacaftor in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 24 months of age is within the range of exposure in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Safety of KALYDECO in this population was derived from a cohort of 7 patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months (mean age 1.9 months at baseline), a cohort of 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (mean age 4.5 months at baseline), a cohort of 11 patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months (mean age 9.0 months at baseline), and a cohort of 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (mean age 15.2 months at baseline) in a 24-week, open-label clinical trial, administered 5.8 mg, 11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, 22.8 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg (11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, and 22.8 mg are not recommended dosages) of ivacaftor granules twice daily (Trial 8). The safety profile of patients in this trial was similar to that observed in patients aged 2 years and older. Safety of KALYDECO in patients aged 1 month and older was evaluated in a 96-week, open-label study (Trial 9) in 86 patients (38 rolled over from Trial 8, and 48 KALYDECO-na\u00efve). Adverse reactions from Trial 9 were generally similar to those reported in Trial 8. The safety and effectiveness of KALYDECO in pediatric patients with CF younger than 1 month of age have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile toxicology study in which ivacaftor was administered to rats from postnatal days 7 to 35, cataracts were observed at all dose levels, ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at oral doses of 10-50 mg/kg/day). This finding has not been observed in older animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use CF is largely a disease of children and young adults. Clinical trials of KALYDECO did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class A): No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients aged 6 months or older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class B): A reduced dosage is recommended in patients aged 6 months or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, use with caution at a reduced dosage, in patients aged 6 months or older with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Due to variability in maturation of cytochrome (CYP) enzymes involved in ivacaftor metabolism, treatment with KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months with any level of hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; however, caution is recommended while using KALYDECO in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. Ivacaftor facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel open probability (or gating) of CFTR protein located at the cell surface. The overall level of ivacaftor-mediated CFTR chloride transport is dependent on the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and how responsive a particular mutant CFTR protein is to ivacaftor potentiation. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. A patient must have at least one CFTR mutation responsive to ivacaftor to be indicated. Note that splice site mutations cannot be studied in the FRT assay. Evidence of clinical efficacy exists for non-canonical splice mutations 2789+5G\u2192A , 3272-26A\u2192G , 3849+10kbC\u2192T , 711+3A\u2192G and E831X and these are listed in Table 3 below [see also Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface that can be potentiated by ivacaftor [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Ivacaftor also increased chloride transport in cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients who carried F508del on one CFTR allele and either G551D or R117H-5T on the second CFTR allele. Table 3 lists mutations that are responsive to ivacaftor based on 1) a positive clinical response and/or 2) in vitro data in FRT cells indicating that ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% over baseline (% of normal). Table 3: List of CFTR Gene Mutations that Produce CFTR Protein and are Responsive to KALYDECO 711+3A\u2192G Clinical data exist for these mutations [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .

In a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial in patients with CF who had a G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , G970R , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene (Trial 4), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment was -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41). The mean changes in sweat chloride for the mutations for which KALYDECO is indicated ranged from -51 to -8, whereas the range for individual subjects with the G970R mutation was -1 to -11 mmol/L. In an open-label clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily (Trial 6), the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment was -45 mmol/L (95% CI -53, -38) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, 8-week crossover study in patients with CF aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and with a second CFTR mutation predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor (Trial 7), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 of treatment for KALYDECO treated patients was -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI -6.7, -2.3). In a 24-week, open-label clinical trial in patients with CF aged less than 24 months administered 5.8 mg, 11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, 22.8 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg (11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, and 22.8 mg are not recommended dosages) of ivacaftor twice daily (Trial 8), the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (n=10) was -73.5 mmol/L (95% CI -86.0, -61.0) at Week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months (n=6) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI -75.9, -41.3) at Week 24, and the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (n=3) was -50 mmol/L (95% CI -93.1, -6.9) at Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks for patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months (n=5) was -40.3 mmol/L (95% CI -76.6, -4.1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of ivacaftor 150 mg and 450 mg twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 72 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia's correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, peak plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 4 hours, and the mean (\u00b1SD) for AUC and C max were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every 12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. Absorption The exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when given with food that contains fat. Therefore, KALYDECO should be administered with fat-containing food. Examples of fat-containing foods include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, yogurt, breast milk, and infant formula), etc. The median (range) T max is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state. KALYDECO granules (2 \u00d7 75 mg) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with fat-containing food in adult subjects. The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for KALYDECO granules and the 150 mg tablet formulation. Distribution Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L. Elimination The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The CL/F (SD) for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. Metabolism Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and clinical studies indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. Excretion Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The following conclusions about exposures between adults and the pediatric population are based on population PK analyses: Table 4: Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group, Mean (SD) Age Group Dose AUC ss (ng\u2219h/mL) 1 to less than 2 months (\u22653 kg) Patients 1 to less than 6 months of age were of \u226537 weeks gestational age. 5.8 mg q12h 5490 (1310) 2 to less than 4 months (\u22653 kg) 13.4 mg q12h 6730 (3650) Exposures for 2 to less than 4 months of age are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model incorporating data for this age group. 4 to less than 6 months (\u22655 kg) 25 mg q12h 6480 (2520) Values based on population PK modeling incorporating data from patients 4 to <6 months of age from Trial 8. 6 to less than 12 months (5 kg to <7 kg) Value based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. 25 mg q12h 5360 6 to less than 12 months (7 kg to <14 kg) 50 mg q12h 9390 (3120) 12 to less than 24 months (7 kg to <14 kg) 50 mg q12h 9050 (3050) 12 to less than 24 months (\u226514 kg to <25 kg) 75 mg q12h 9600 (1800) 2 to less than 6 years (<14 kg) 50 mg q12h 10500 (4260) 2 to less than 6 years (\u226514 kg to <25 kg) 75 mg q12h 11300 (3820) 6 to less than 12 years 150 mg q12h 20000 (8330) 12 to less than 18 years 150 mg q12h 9240 (3420) Adults (\u226518 years) 150 mg q12h 10700 (4100) Patients with Hepatic Impairment Adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B) had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately twofold increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Based on simulations of these results, a reduced KALYDECO dosage to one tablet or packet of granules once daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e is expected to be less than twofold. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older at a dosage of one tablet or one packet of granules given once daily or less frequently [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months with any level of hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment patients because of minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in a human PK study); however, caution is recommended when administering KALYDECO to patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Male and Female Patients The effect of gender on KALYDECO pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics of data from clinical studies of KALYDECO. No dosage adjustments are necessary based on gender. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with KALYDECO and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Dosing recommendations based on clinical studies or potential drug interactions with KALYDECO are presented below. Potential for Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, ivacaftor and metabolite M1 have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Clinical studies showed that KALYDECO is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but not an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor and M1 may inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro , ivacaftor, M1, and M6 were not inducers of CYP isozymes. Dosing recommendations for co-administered drugs with KALYDECO are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Impact of KALYDECO on Other Drugs Note: The data obtained with substrates but without co-administration of KALYDECO are used as reference. * NE: Norethindrone; ** EE: Ethinyl Estradiol The vertical lines are at 0.8, 1.0, and 1.25, respectively. Figure 1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Ivacaftor In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor and metabolite M1 were substrates of CYP3A enzymes (i.e., CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Exposure to ivacaftor is reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. KALYDECO dosing recommendations for co-administration with other drugs are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Impact of Other Drugs on KALYDECO Note: The data obtained for KALYDECO without co-administration of inducers or inhibitors are used as reference. The vertical lines are at 0.8, 1.0, and 1.25, respectively. Figure 2"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. Ivacaftor facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel open probability (or gating) of CFTR protein located at the cell surface. The overall level of ivacaftor-mediated CFTR chloride transport is dependent on the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and how responsive a particular mutant CFTR protein is to ivacaftor potentiation. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. A patient must have at least one CFTR mutation responsive to ivacaftor to be indicated. Note that splice site mutations cannot be studied in the FRT assay. Evidence of clinical efficacy exists for non-canonical splice mutations 2789+5G\u2192A , 3272-26A\u2192G , 3849+10kbC\u2192T , 711+3A\u2192G and E831X and these are listed in Table 3 below [see also Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface that can be potentiated by ivacaftor [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Ivacaftor also increased chloride transport in cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients who carried F508del on one CFTR allele and either G551D or R117H-5T on the second CFTR allele. Table 3 lists mutations that are responsive to ivacaftor based on 1) a positive clinical response and/or 2) in vitro data in FRT cells indicating that ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% over baseline (% of normal).

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sweat Chloride Evaluation Changes in sweat chloride (a biomarker) response to KALYDECO were evaluated in seven clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial in patients with CF who had a G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , G970R , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene (Trial 4), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment was -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41). The mean changes in sweat chloride for the mutations for which KALYDECO is indicated ranged from -51 to -8, whereas the range for individual subjects with the G970R mutation was -1 to -11 mmol/L. In an open-label clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily (Trial 6), the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment was -45 mmol/L (95% CI -53, -38) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, 8-week crossover study in patients with CF aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and with a second CFTR mutation predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor (Trial 7), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 of treatment for KALYDECO treated patients was -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI -6.7, -2.3). In a 24-week, open-label clinical trial in patients with CF aged less than 24 months administered 5.8 mg, 11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, 22.8 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg (11.4 mg, 17.1 mg, and 22.8 mg are not recommended dosages) of ivacaftor twice daily (Trial 8), the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (n=10) was -73.5 mmol/L (95% CI -86.0, -61.0) at Week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months (n=6) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI -75.9, -41.3) at Week 24, and the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride for patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (n=3) was -50 mmol/L (95% CI -93.1, -6.9) at Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks for patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months (n=5) was -40.3 mmol/L (95% CI -76.6, -4.1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of ivacaftor 150 mg and 450 mg twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 72 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia's correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, peak plasma concentrations (T max ) occurred at approximately 4 hours, and the mean (\u00b1SD) for AUC and C max were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every 12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. Absorption The exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when given with food that contains fat. Therefore, KALYDECO should be administered with fat-containing food. Examples of fat-containing foods include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, yogurt, breast milk, and infant formula), etc. The median (range) T max is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state. KALYDECO granules (2 \u00d7 75 mg) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with fat-containing food in adult subjects. The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for KALYDECO granules and the 150 mg tablet formulation. Distribution Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L. Elimination The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The CL/F (SD) for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. Metabolism Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and clinical studies indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. Excretion Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The following conclusions about exposures between adults and the pediatric population are based on population PK analyses: Table 4: Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group, Mean (SD) Age Group Dose AUC ss (ng\u2219h/mL) 1 to less than 2 months (\u22653 kg) Patients 1 to less than 6 months of age were of \u226537 weeks gestational age. 5.8 mg q12h 5490 (1310) 2 to less than 4 months (\u22653 kg) 13.4 mg q12h 6730 (3650) Exposures for 2 to less than 4 months of age are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model incorporating data for this age group. 4 to less than 6 months (\u22655 kg) 25 mg q12h 6480 (2520) Values based on population PK modeling incorporating data from patients 4 to <6 months of age from Trial 8. 6 to less than 12 months (5 kg to <7 kg) Value based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. 25 mg q12h 5360 6 to less than 12 months (7 kg to <14 kg) 50 mg q12h 9390 (3120) 12 to less than 24 months (7 kg to <14 kg) 50 mg q12h 9050 (3050) 12 to less than 24 months (\u226514 kg to <25 kg) 75 mg q12h 9600 (1800) 2 to less than 6 years (<14 kg) 50 mg q12h 10500 (4260) 2 to less than 6 years (\u226514 kg to <25 kg) 75 mg q12h 11300 (3820) 6 to less than 12 years 150 mg q12h 20000 (8330) 12 to less than 18 years 150 mg q12h 9240 (3420) Adults (\u226518 years) 150 mg q12h 10700 (4100) Patients with Hepatic Impairment Adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B) had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately twofold increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Based on simulations of these results, a reduced KALYDECO dosage to one tablet or packet of granules once daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e is expected to be less than twofold. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment aged 6 months and older at a dosage of one tablet or one packet of granules given once daily or less frequently [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months with any level of hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment patients because of minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in a human PK study); however, caution is recommended when administering KALYDECO to patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Male and Female Patients The effect of gender on KALYDECO pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics of data from clinical studies of KALYDECO. No dosage adjustments are necessary based on gender. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with KALYDECO and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Dosing recommendations based on clinical studies or potential drug interactions with KALYDECO are presented below. Potential for Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, ivacaftor and metabolite M1 have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Clinical studies showed that KALYDECO is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but not an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor and M1 may inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro , ivacaftor, M1, and M6 were not inducers of CYP isozymes. Dosing recommendations for co-administered drugs with KALYDECO are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Impact of KALYDECO on Other Drugs Note: The data obtained with substrates but without co-administration of KALYDECO are used as reference. * NE: Norethindrone; ** EE: Ethinyl Estradiol The vertical lines are at 0.8, 1.0, and 1.25, respectively. Figure 1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Ivacaftor In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor and metabolite M1 were substrates of CYP3A enzymes (i.e., CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Exposure to ivacaftor is reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. KALYDECO dosing recommendations for co-administration with other drugs are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Impact of Other Drugs on KALYDECO Note: The data obtained for KALYDECO without co-administration of inducers or inhibitors are used as reference. The vertical lines are at 0.8, 1.0, and 1.25, respectively. Figure 2"

No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice or rats at ivacaftor oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equal to 1 and 4 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 8 and 5 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its major metabolites). Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg/kg/day. Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea, implantations, and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its major metabolites) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day were attributed to severe toxicity.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Trials in Patients with CF who have a G551D Mutation in the CFTR Gene Dose Ranging: Dose ranging for the clinical program consisted primarily of one double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 39 adult (mean age 31 years) Caucasian patients with CF who had FEV 1 \u226540% predicted. Twenty patients with median predicted FEV 1 at baseline of 56% (range: 42% to 109%) received KALYDECO 25, 75, 150 mg, or placebo every 12 hours for 14 days and 19 patients with median predicted FEV 1 at baseline of 69% (range: 40% to 122%) received KALYDECO 150, 250 mg, or placebo every 12 hours for 28 days. The selection of the 150 mg every 12 hours dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (pre-dose FEV 1 ) and changes in pharmacodynamic parameters (sweat chloride and nasal potential difference). The twice-daily dosing regimen was primarily based on an apparent terminal plasma half-life of approximately 12 hours. Efficacy: The efficacy of KALYDECO in patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 213 clinically stable patients with CF (109 receiving KALYDECO 150 mg twice daily). All eligible patients from these trials were rolled over into an open-label extension study. Trial 1 evaluated 161 patients with CF who were 12 years of age or older (mean age 26 years) with FEV 1 at screening between 40-90% predicted [mean FEV 1 64% predicted at baseline (range: 32% to 98%)]. Trial 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age (mean age 9 years) with FEV 1 at screening between 40-105% predicted [mean FEV 1 84% predicted at baseline (range: 44% to 134%)]. Patients who had persistent Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from sputum at screening and those with abnormal liver function defined as 3 or more liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, GGT, total bilirubin) \u22653 times the ULN were excluded. Patients in both trials were randomized 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of KALYDECO or placebo every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., tobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted pre-dose FEV 1 through 24 weeks of treatment. In both studies, treatment with KALYDECO resulted in a significant improvement in FEV 1 . The treatment difference between KALYDECO and placebo for the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 was 10.6 percentage points ( P <0.0001) in Trial 1 and 12.5 percentage points ( P <0.0001) in Trial 2 (Figure 3). These changes persisted through 48 weeks. Improvements in percent predicted FEV 1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex, and geographic region. Figure 3: Mean Absolute Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV 1 Primary endpoint was assessed at the 24-week time point. Other efficacy variables included absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], time to first pulmonary exacerbation (Trial 1 only), absolute change from baseline in weight, and improvement from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score, a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF such as cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing. For the purpose of the study, a pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre-specified sino-pulmonary signs/symptoms. Patients treated with KALYDECO demonstrated statistically significant improvements in risk of pulmonary exacerbations, CF symptoms (in Trial 1 only), and gain in body weight (Table 5). Weight data, when expressed as body mass index normalized for age and sex in patients <20 years of age, were consistent with absolute change from baseline in weight.

Patients who completed Part 1 of this trial continued into the 16-week open-label Part 2 of the study. The mutations studied were G178R , S549N , S549R , G551S , G970R , G1244E , S1251N , S1255P , and G1349D. See Clinical Studies (14.1) for efficacy in patients with a G551D mutation. Patients were 6 years of age or older (mean age 23 years) with FEV 1 \u226540% at screening [mean FEV 1 at baseline 78% predicted (range: 43% to 119%)]. Patients with evidence of colonization with Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus and those with abnormal liver function defined as 3 or more liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, GGT, total bilirubin) \u22653 times the ULN at screening were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of KALYDECO or placebo every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies during the first treatment period and crossed over to the other treatment for the second 8 weeks. The two 8-week treatment periods were separated by a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted. The primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV 1 through 8 weeks of treatment. Other efficacy variables included absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 8 weeks of treatment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], absolute change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at 8 weeks of treatment (including body weight at 8 weeks), and improvement in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through 8 weeks of treatment. For the overall population of the 9 mutations studied, treatment with KALYDECO compared to placebo resulted in significant improvement in percent predicted FEV 1 [10.7 through Week 8 ( P <0.0001)], BMI [0.66 kg/m 2 at Week 8 ( P <0.0001)], and CFQ-R respiratory domain score [9.6 through Week 8 ( P =0.0004)]; however, there was a high degree of variability of efficacy responses among the 9 mutations (Table 6).

(-71, -54) 14.3 Trial in Patients with CF who have an R117H Mutation in the CFTR Gene The efficacy and safety of KALYDECO in patients with CF who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (Trial 5). Fifty-nine of 69 patients completed 24 weeks of treatment. Two patients discontinued and 8 patients did not complete treatment due to study termination. Trial 5 evaluated 69 clinically stable patients with CF who were 6 years of age or older (mean age 31 years). Patients who were aged 12 years and older had FEV 1 at screening between 40-90% predicted, and patients who were 6-11 years of age had FEV 1 at screening between 40-105% predicted. The overall mean FEV 1 was 73% predicted at baseline (range: 33% to 106%). The patients had well preserved BMIs (mean overall: 23.76 kg/m 2 ) and a high proportion were pancreatic sufficient as assessed by a low rate of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy use (pancreatin: 11.6%; pancrelipase: 5.8%). Patients who had persistent Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from sputum at screening, and those with abnormal liver function defined as 3 or more liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, GGT, total bilirubin) \u22653 times the ULN, were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of KALYDECO (n=34) or placebo (n=35) every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV 1 through 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment difference for absolute change in percent predicted FEV 1 through Week 24 was 2.1 percentage points (analysis conducted with the full analysis set which included all 69 patients) and did not reach statistical significance (Table 7). Other efficacy variables that were analyzed included absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24, improvement in cystic fibrosis respiratory symptoms through Week 24 as assessed by the CFQ-R respiratory domain score (Table 7), absolute change in body mass index (BMI) at Week 24, and time to first pulmonary exacerbation. The overall treatment difference for the absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 was 0.3 kg/m 2 and the calculated hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 0.93, which were not statistically significant. Statistically significant improvements in clinical efficacy (FEV 1 , CFQ-R respiratory domain score) were seen in several subgroup analyses and decreases in sweat chloride were observed in all subgroups. The mean baseline sweat chloride for all patients was 70 mmol/L. Subgroups analyzed included those based on age, lung function, and poly-T status (Table 7).

Mutations predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor were selected for the study based on the clinical phenotype (pancreatic sufficiency), biomarker data (sweat chloride), and in vitro responsiveness to ivacaftor. Eligible patients were heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a second mutation predicted to be responsive to ivacaftor. Of the 244 patients included in the efficacy analysis, who were randomized and dosed, 146 patients had a splice mutation and 98 patients had a missense mutation, as the second allele. 156 patients received KALYDECO and 161 patients received placebo. Patients were aged 12 years and older (mean age 35 years [range 12-72]) and had a percent predicted FEV 1 at screening between 40-90 [mean ppFEV 1 at study baseline 62 (range: 35 to 94)]. Patients with evidence of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status (e.g., Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus ) and those with abnormal liver function at screening were excluded. Abnormal liver function was defined as 2 or more liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) \u22653 times the ULN or total bilirubin \u22652 times the ULN, or a single increase in ALT/AST \u22655 times the ULN. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean absolute change from study baseline in percent predicted FEV 1 averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from study baseline averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. For the overall population, treatment with KALYDECO compared to placebo resulted in significant improvement in ppFEV 1 [4.7 percent points from study baseline to average of Week 4 and Week 8 ( P <0.0001)] and CFQ-R respiratory domain score [9.7 points from study baseline to average of Week 4 and Week 8 ( P <0.0001)]. Statistically significant improvements compared to placebo were also observed in the subgroup of patients with splice mutations and missense mutations (Table 8).

Patients were randomized 4:1 to receive KALYDECO 150 mg (n=112) every 12 hours or placebo (n=28) in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The mean age of patients enrolled was 23 years and the mean baseline FEV 1 was 79% predicted (range: 40% to 129%). As in Trials 1 and 2, patients who had persistent Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from sputum at screening and those with abnormal liver function defined as 3 or more liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, GGT, total bilirubin) \u22653 times the ULN were excluded. The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted. The primary endpoint was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline through Week 16 in percent predicted FEV 1 . The treatment difference from placebo for the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV 1 through Week 16 in patients with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene was 1.72 percentage points (1.5% and -0.2% for patients in the KALYDECO and placebo-treated groups, respectively) and did not reach statistical significance (Table 9). Other efficacy variables that were analyzed included absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 16, change in cystic fibrosis respiratory symptoms through Week 16 as assessed by the CFQ-R respiratory domain score (Table 9), change in weight through Week 16, and rate of pulmonary exacerbation. The overall treatment difference for change from baseline in weight through Week 16 was -0.16 kg (95% CI -1.06, 0.74); the rate ratio for pulmonary exacerbation was 0.677 (95% CI 0.33, 1.37).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information ). Transaminase (ALT or AST) Elevations and Monitoring Inform patients that elevation in liver tests have occurred in patients treated with KALYDECO. Liver function tests will be performed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. More frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered in patients with a history of transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis are possible with use of KALYDECO. Inform patients of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including rash, hives, itching, facial swelling, tightness of the chest and wheezing. Advise patients to discontinue use of KALYDECO immediately and contact their physician or go to the emergency department if these symptoms occur. Intracranial Hypertension Inform patients that intracranial hypertension has occurred in patients who received drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as KALYDECO. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider right away if they experience signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, including headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inducers and Inhibitors Ask patients to tell you all the medications they are taking including any herbal supplements or vitamins. Co-administration of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended, as they may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of KALYDECO. Dosage reduction is recommended when patients aged 6 months and older are taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Treatment with KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months who are taking concomitant moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided [ see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Inquire and/or assess whether patients have liver impairment. Reduce the dosage of KALYDECO in patients aged 6 months and older with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B) to one tablet or one packet of granules once daily. KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); however, exposure is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients aged 6 months and older with severe hepatic impairment at a reduced dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Treatment with KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months with any signs of hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients 6 months and older with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Driving and Operating Machinery Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving KALYDECO, which could influence the ability to drive or operate machines [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Advise patients not to drive or operate machines if they experience dizziness until symptoms abate. Administration KALYDECO (ivacaftor) tablets 150 mg Inform patients that KALYDECO tablet is best absorbed by the body when taken with food that contains fat. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. KALYDECO (ivacaftor) oral granules 5.8 mg, 13.4 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg Inform patients and caregivers that KALYDECO oral granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and completely consumed to ensure delivery of the entire dose. Food or liquid should be at or below room temperature. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be consumed during this period. Some examples of appropriate soft foods or liquids may include pur\u00e9ed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, applesauce, water, breast milk, infant formula, milk, or juice. Inform patients and caregivers that KALYDECO is best absorbed by the body when taken with food that contains fat; therefore, KALYDECO oral granules should be taken just before or just after consuming food that contains fat. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, yogurt, breast milk, and infant formula), etc. Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of KALYDECO: In case a dose of KALYDECO is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of KALYDECO with fat-containing food as soon as possible. If more than 6 hours have passed since KALYDECO is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken, and the patient should resume the recommended dosing schedule. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider if they have questions. Cataracts Inform patients that abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents receiving KALYDECO. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations should be performed in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE SYMDEKO is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . If the patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when recommended by the mutation test instructions for use. SYMDEKO is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence. ( 12.1 , 14 ) If the patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when recommended by the mutation test instructions for use.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing less than 30 kg: one tablet (containing tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg) in the morning and one tablet (containing ivacaftor 75 mg) in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. SYMDEKO should be taken with fat-containing food. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 12.3 ) Adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older or pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing 30 kg or more: one tablet (containing tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg) in the morning and one tablet (containing ivacaftor 150 mg) in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. SYMDEKO should be taken with fat-containing food. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 12.3 ) Reduce dosage in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.3 , 8.6 , 12.3 ) See full prescribing information for dosage modifications due to drug interactions with SYMDEKO. ( 2.4 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) 2.1 General Dosage Information Swallow the tablets whole. SYMDEKO should be taken with fat-containing food, such as food recommended in standard nutritional guidelines. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats, etc. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Adults, Adolescents, and Children Aged 6 Years and Older Adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1. The morning and the evening doses should be taken approximately 12 hours apart. Table 1: Recommended Dosage for Patients Aged 6 Years and Older Age Morning (one tablet) Evening (one tablet) 6 to <12 years weighing <30 kg tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg ivacaftor 75 mg 6 to <12 years weighing \u226530 kg tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg ivacaftor 150 mg \u226512 years tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg ivacaftor 150 mg Information for Missed Doses: If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule. If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled dose can be taken at the usual time. More than one dose should not be taken at the same time. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment For dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment, refer to Table 2. Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, SYMDEKO should be used with caution at an adjusted dosage after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Table 2: Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic Impairment Morning Evening Patients Aged 6 to <12 Years Weighing <30 kg Patients Aged 6 to <12 Years Weighing \u226530 kg and Patients Age \u226512 Years All Patients Mild (Child-Pugh Class A) No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) One tablet of tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg once daily One tablet of tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily No ivacaftor dose Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) One tablet of tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg once daily (or less frequently) One tablet of tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily (or less frequently) 2.4 Dosage Adjustment for Patients Taking Drugs that are CYP3A Inhibitors The dosing regimen of SYMDEKO should be adjusted when co-administered with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elevated transaminases (ALT or AST): Transaminases (ALT and AST) should be assessed prior to initiating SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. In patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with significant elevations of transaminases, e.g., patients with ALT or AST >5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN with bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment. ( 5.1 , 6 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis has been reported with SYMDEKO in the postmarketing setting. Initiate appropriate therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.2 ) Intracranial hypertension : Intracranial hypertension (IH) has been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as SYMDEKO. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt SYMDEKO and refer for prompt medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) substantially decrease exposure of ivacaftor and may decrease the exposure of tezacaftor, which may reduce therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating SYMDEKO treatment. ( 5.5 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Transaminase (AST/ALT) Elevations Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients with CF treated with SYMDEKO, as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy. Assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) are recommended for all patients prior to initiating SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations more frequent monitoring should be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases, e.g., patients with ALT or AST >5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN with bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN, dosing should be interrupted and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the resolution of transaminase elevations consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of anaphylaxis, have been reported in the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue SYMDEKO and institute appropriate therapy. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with SYMDEKO. 5.3 Intracranial Hypertension Cases of intracranial hypertension (IH) have been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as SYMDEKO [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and potential vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt SYMDEKO and refer for prompt medical evaluation. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with SYMDEKO. Patients should be monitored until IH resolution and for recurrence. Patients with elevated vitamin A levels may be at increased risk. 5.4 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposure to tezacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of SYMDEKO. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.5 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO, as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with SYMDEKO cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with SYMDEKO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Transaminase Elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to SYMDEKO (occurring in \u22653% of patients) were headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The overall safety profile of SYMDEKO is based on data from 1001 patients in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials: two parallel-group trials of 12 and 24-week duration and one cross-over design trial of 8 weeks duration. Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open-label extension safety study (up to 96 weeks of SYMDEKO). In the three placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3), a total of 496 patients with CF aged 12 years and older received at least one dose of SYMDEKO. The proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse reactions was 1.6% for SYMDEKO-treated patients and 2.0% for placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in SYMDEKO-treated patients compared to placebo included distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, 3 (0.6%) SYMDEKO-treated patients vs. 0 placebo. There were no deaths in the placebo-controlled trials, and one death in the open-label extension study due to respiratory failure and influenza infection in a patient who had discontinued SYMDEKO seven weeks prior. The safety profile of SYMDEKO was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, sex, baseline percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), and geographic regions. Table 5 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u22653% of SYMDEKO-treated patients that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients in the 12- and 24-week placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials (Trials 1 and 3). Table 5: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in \u22653% of SYMDEKO-Treated Patients and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reactions (Preferred Term) SYMDEKO N=334 n (%) Placebo N=343 n (%) Headache 49 (15) 44 (13) Nausea 29 (9) 24 (7) Sinus congestion 13 (4) 6 (2) Dizziness 12 (4) 8 (2) The safety data from the following trials are similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3: an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 244 patients with CF aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trial 2). a 24-week open-label study in 70 patients with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years who were either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trial 4). Laboratory Abnormalities Transaminase elevations During the placebo-controlled trials in patients aged 12 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN) was similar between SYMDEKO-treated patients and placebo-treated patients; 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in SYMDEKO-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on SYMDEKO and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No SYMDEKO-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation >3 \u00d7 ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN. During the 24-week, open-label study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (Trial 4), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN were 1.4%, 4.3%, and 10.0%, respectively. No SYMDEKO-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation >3 \u00d7 ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN or discontinued SYMDEKO treatment due to transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Postmarketing Adverse Reactions with SYMDEKO The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of SYMDEKO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential for other drugs to affect tezacaftor/ivacaftor CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce SYMDEKO dosage when co-administered with strong (e.g., ketoconazole) or moderate (e.g., fluconazole) CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid food containing grapefruit. ( 2.4 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Inducers of CYP3A Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates of CYP3A (ivacaftor is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced SYMDEKO efficacy. Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) by 89%. Tezacaftor exposures can also be expected to decrease significantly during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers. Therefore, co-administration of SYMDEKO with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include: rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) 7.2 Inhibitors of CYP3A Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased tezacaftor exposure (AUC) by 4.0-fold and ivacaftor by 15.6-fold. When co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors, the dosing regimen of SYMDEKO should be adjusted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole telithromycin and clarithromycin Co-administration of fluconazole increased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 3.0-fold. Simulation suggested co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, may increase tezacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 2.0-fold. When co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the dosing regimen of SYMDEKO should be adjusted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include: fluconazole erythromycin Co-administration of SYMDEKO with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor; therefore, food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with SYMDEKO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 7.3 Ciprofloxacin Co-administration of SYMDEKO with ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on the exposure of tezacaftor or ivacaftor. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of SYMDEKO with ciprofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Potential for tezacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other drugs 7.4 CYP3A Substrates Co-administration of SYMDEKO with midazolam (oral), a sensitive CYP3A substrate, did not affect midazolam exposure. No dosage adjustment of CYP3A substrates is required when co-administered with SYMDEKO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 CYP2C9 Substrates Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during co-administration of SYMDEKO with warfarin is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased by SYMDEKO include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.6 Digoxin and Other P-gp Substrates Co-administration of SYMDEKO with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of SYMDEKO may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.7 Hormonal Contraceptives SYMDEKO has been studied with an ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone oral contraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the hormonal contraceptive. SYMDEKO is not expected to modify the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports on the use of SYMDEKO or its individual components, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Although there are no animal reproduction studies with the concomitant administration of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, separate reproductive and developmental studies were conducted with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in pregnant rats and rabbits. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of tezacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 3 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and 0.2 times the MRHD in rabbits (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite). Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 6 and 16 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively. No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of either tezacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from the period of organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 1 and 4 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Tezacaftor In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6-17, tezacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-20, tezacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 0.2 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at maternal oral doses up to 25 mg/kg/day). Lower fetal body weights were observed in rabbits at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures approximately 1 times the MRHD (at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development (PPND) study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18, tezacaftor had no adverse developmental effects on pups at an exposure of approximately 1 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at a maternal dose of 25 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights and early developmental delays in pinna detachment, eye opening, and righting reflex occurred at a maternally toxic dose (based on maternal weight loss) that produced exposures approximately 2 times the exposure at the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at a maternal oral dose of 50 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of tezacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. Ivacaftor In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-17, ivacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 6 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-19, ivacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 16 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). In a PPND study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 4 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 6 times the MRHD. Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tezacaftor or ivacaftor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Both tezacaftor and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SYMDEKO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SYMDEKO or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Tezacaftor Lacteal excretion of tezacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (30 mg/kg) of 14 C-tezacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-tezacaftor in milk was approximately 3 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-72h ). Ivacaftor Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-ivacaftor in milk was approximately 1.5 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-24h ). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SYMDEKO for the treatment of CF have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. Clinical trials included the following patients with CF: 12 to less than 18 years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12 to less than 18 years of age who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 6 to less than 12 years of age who are either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. The effectiveness of SYMDEKO in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years and in patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety of SYMDEKO in this population was derived from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 70 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at screening 8.1 years) administered either tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg or tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg, 12 hours apart (Trial 4). The safety profile for patients in this trial was similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of SYMDEKO in patients with CF younger than 6 years of age have not been studied. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 35 with ivacaftor dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day and higher (0.25 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites). This finding has not been observed in older animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of SYMDEKO did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). A reduced dosage of SYMDEKO is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). There is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but tezacaftor/ivacaftor exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, use with caution at a reduced dosage in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.8 Patients with Severe Lung Dysfunction Trial 1 and Trial 2 included a total of 39 SYMDEKO-treated patients with ppFEV 1 <40 at baseline (range: 30-40); 23 patients in Trial 1 and 16 patients in Trial 2. There were 24 placebo-treated patients in Trial 1, and 15 placebo- and 13 ivacaftor-treated patients in Trial 2, with ppFEV 1 <40 at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were comparable to the overall results observed in both Trials 1 and 2."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tezacaftor facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of mature CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone. The combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to tezacaftor/ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. Note that splice site mutations cannot be studied in the FRT assay. Table 6 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on (1) a clinical FEV 1 response and/or (2) in vitro data in FRT cells, indicating that tezacaftor/ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% of normal over baseline. CFTR gene mutations that are not responsive to ivacaftor alone are not expected to respond to SYMDEKO except for F508del homozygotes.

In Trial 2 (patients aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor), the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between SYMDEKO and placebo, and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo. In Trial 4 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years) a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline through Week 4 and sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period. Mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -14.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -17.4, -11.6). Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose, tezacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. In a separate study of ivacaftor evaluating doses up to 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose, ivacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. Following once-daily dosing of tezacaftor and twice-daily dosing of ivacaftor in patients with CF, plasma concentrations of tezacaftor and ivacaftor reach steady-state within 8 days and within 3 to 5 days, respectively, after starting treatment. At steady-state, the accumulation ratio is approximately 1.5 for tezacaftor and 2.2 for ivacaftor. Exposures of tezacaftor (administered alone or in combination with ivacaftor) increase in an approximately dose-proportional manner with increasing doses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for tezacaftor and ivacaftor at steady state are shown in Table 7. Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor at Steady State in Patients with CF Drug C max (mcg/mL) Effective t \u00bd (h) AUC 0-24h or AUC 0-12h (mcg\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-24h for tezacaftor and AUC 0-12h for ivacaftor Tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours Tezacaftor 5.95 (1.50) 15.0 (3.44) 84.5 (27.8) Ivacaftor 1.17 (0.424) 13.7 (6.06) 11.3 (4.60) Absorption After a single dose in healthy subjects in the fed state, tezacaftor was absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (t max ) of approximately 4 hours (2 to 6 hours). The median (range) t max of ivacaftor was approximately 6 hours (3 to 10 hours) in the fed state. When a single dose of tezacaftor/ivacaftor was administered with fat-containing foods, tezacaftor exposure was similar and ivacaftor exposure was approximately 3 times higher than when taken in a fasting state. Distribution Tezacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 271 (157) L and 206 (82.9) L, respectively. Neither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells. Elimination After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent clearance values of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were 1.31 (0.41) and 15.7 (6.38) L/h, respectively. After steady-state dosing of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF, the effective half-lives of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were approximately 15 (3.44) and 13.7 (6.06) hours, respectively. Metabolism Tezacaftor is metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro data suggested that tezacaftor is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14 C-tezacaftor to healthy male subjects, M1, M2, and M5 were the three major circulating metabolites of tezacaftor in humans. M1 has the similar potency to that of tezacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M2 is much less pharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1, and M5 is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3, is formed by direct glucuronidation of tezacaftor. Ivacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 is not considered pharmacologically active. Excretion Following oral administration of 14 C-tezacaftor, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the feces (unchanged or as the M2 metabolite) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2 metabolite), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 21 days after the dose. Less than 1% of the administrated dose was excreted in urine as unchanged tezacaftor, showing that renal excretion is not the major pathway of tezacaftor elimination in humans. Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. There was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine), and there was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Based on population PK analyses, the PK exposure parameters of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children and adolescents (ages 6 to <18 years) are similar to the AUCss range observed in adults when given in combination. Pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years Table 8: Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group, Mean (SD) Age Group Dose Tezacaftor AUCss mcg\u2219h/mL AUC 0-24h for tezacaftor and AUC 0-12h for ivacaftor Ivacaftor AUCss mcg\u2219h/mL 6 to <12 years Exposures in \u2265 30 kg weight range are predictions derived from the population PK model 71.3 (28.3) 8.5 (3.34) 6 to <12 years (<30 kg) tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg 56.7 (22.3) 6.92 (2.07) 6 to <12 years (\u226530 kg) tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 92.7 (21.9) 10.8 (3.52) Pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years Following oral administration of SYMDEKO tablets, tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUCss for tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 97.1 (35.8) mcg\u2219h/mL and 11.4 (5.50) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively, similar to the mean AUCss in adult patients administered SYMDEKO tablets, tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an approximately 36% increase in AUC and a 10% increase in C max for tezacaftor, and a 1.5-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. In a separate study, patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15) receiving SYMDEKO. The magnitude of increase in exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u226430 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. In a human pharmacokinetic study with tezacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of tezacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 13.7% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0.79% as unchanged drug). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). In population pharmacokinetic analysis, data from 665 patients on tezacaftor or tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in clinical trials indicated that mild renal impairment (N=147; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (N=7; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) did not affect the clearance of tezacaftor significantly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interactions Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with SYMDEKO and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Clinical studies (with rosiglitazone and desipramine \u2013 see Table 9 ) showed that ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp, and may also inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro , ivacaftor was not an inducer of CYP isozymes. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Based on in vitro results, tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Tezacaftor has a low potential to induce CYP3A, but it is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Clinical studies with midazolam showed that SYMDEKO is not an inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with an ethinyl estradiol/ norethindrone oral contraceptive had no significant effect on the exposures of the hormonal contraceptives. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of pitavastatin. The effects of tezacaftor and ivacaftor (or ivacaftor alone) on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 9 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor and tezacaftor were substrates of CYP3A enzymes ( i.e. , CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Exposure to ivacaftor and tezacaftor will be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that tezacaftor is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1, and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Tezacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B3. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor (or ivacaftor alone) are shown in Table 10 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tezacaftor facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of mature CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone. The combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to tezacaftor/ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. Note that splice site mutations cannot be studied in the FRT assay. Table 6 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on (1) a clinical FEV 1 response and/or (2) in vitro data in FRT cells, indicating that tezacaftor/ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% of normal over baseline. CFTR gene mutations that are not responsive to ivacaftor alone are not expected to respond to SYMDEKO except for F508del homozygotes.

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Sweat Chloride In Trial 1 (patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference between SYMDEKO and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8). In Trial 2 (patients aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor), the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between SYMDEKO and placebo, and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo. In Trial 4 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years) a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline through Week 4 and sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period. Mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -14.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -17.4, -11.6). Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose, tezacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. In a separate study of ivacaftor evaluating doses up to 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose, ivacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. Following once-daily dosing of tezacaftor and twice-daily dosing of ivacaftor in patients with CF, plasma concentrations of tezacaftor and ivacaftor reach steady-state within 8 days and within 3 to 5 days, respectively, after starting treatment. At steady-state, the accumulation ratio is approximately 1.5 for tezacaftor and 2.2 for ivacaftor. Exposures of tezacaftor (administered alone or in combination with ivacaftor) increase in an approximately dose-proportional manner with increasing doses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for tezacaftor and ivacaftor at steady state are shown in Table 7. Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor at Steady State in Patients with CF Drug C max (mcg/mL) Effective t \u00bd (h) AUC 0-24h or AUC 0-12h (mcg\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-24h for tezacaftor and AUC 0-12h for ivacaftor Tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours Tezacaftor 5.95 (1.50) 15.0 (3.44) 84.5 (27.8) Ivacaftor 1.17 (0.424) 13.7 (6.06) 11.3 (4.60) Absorption After a single dose in healthy subjects in the fed state, tezacaftor was absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (t max ) of approximately 4 hours (2 to 6 hours). The median (range) t max of ivacaftor was approximately 6 hours (3 to 10 hours) in the fed state. When a single dose of tezacaftor/ivacaftor was administered with fat-containing foods, tezacaftor exposure was similar and ivacaftor exposure was approximately 3 times higher than when taken in a fasting state. Distribution Tezacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 271 (157) L and 206 (82.9) L, respectively. Neither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells. Elimination After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent clearance values of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were 1.31 (0.41) and 15.7 (6.38) L/h, respectively. After steady-state dosing of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF, the effective half-lives of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were approximately 15 (3.44) and 13.7 (6.06) hours, respectively. Metabolism Tezacaftor is metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro data suggested that tezacaftor is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14 C-tezacaftor to healthy male subjects, M1, M2, and M5 were the three major circulating metabolites of tezacaftor in humans. M1 has the similar potency to that of tezacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M2 is much less pharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1, and M5 is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3, is formed by direct glucuronidation of tezacaftor. Ivacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 is not considered pharmacologically active. Excretion Following oral administration of 14 C-tezacaftor, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the feces (unchanged or as the M2 metabolite) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2 metabolite), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 21 days after the dose. Less than 1% of the administrated dose was excreted in urine as unchanged tezacaftor, showing that renal excretion is not the major pathway of tezacaftor elimination in humans. Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. There was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine), and there was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Based on population PK analyses, the PK exposure parameters of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children and adolescents (ages 6 to <18 years) are similar to the AUCss range observed in adults when given in combination. Pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years Table 8: Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group, Mean (SD) Age Group Dose Tezacaftor AUCss mcg\u2219h/mL AUC 0-24h for tezacaftor and AUC 0-12h for ivacaftor Ivacaftor AUCss mcg\u2219h/mL 6 to <12 years Exposures in \u2265 30 kg weight range are predictions derived from the population PK model 71.3 (28.3) 8.5 (3.34) 6 to <12 years (<30 kg) tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg 56.7 (22.3) 6.92 (2.07) 6 to <12 years (\u226530 kg) tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 92.7 (21.9) 10.8 (3.52) Pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years Following oral administration of SYMDEKO tablets, tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUCss for tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 97.1 (35.8) mcg\u2219h/mL and 11.4 (5.50) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively, similar to the mean AUCss in adult patients administered SYMDEKO tablets, tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an approximately 36% increase in AUC and a 10% increase in C max for tezacaftor, and a 1.5-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. In a separate study, patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15) receiving SYMDEKO. The magnitude of increase in exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u226430 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. In a human pharmacokinetic study with tezacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of tezacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 13.7% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0.79% as unchanged drug). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). In population pharmacokinetic analysis, data from 665 patients on tezacaftor or tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in clinical trials indicated that mild renal impairment (N=147; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (N=7; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) did not affect the clearance of tezacaftor significantly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interactions Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with SYMDEKO and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Clinical studies (with rosiglitazone and desipramine \u2013 see Table 9 ) showed that ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp, and may also inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro , ivacaftor was not an inducer of CYP isozymes. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Based on in vitro results, tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Tezacaftor has a low potential to induce CYP3A, but it is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Clinical studies with midazolam showed that SYMDEKO is not an inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with an ethinyl estradiol/ norethindrone oral contraceptive had no significant effect on the exposures of the hormonal contraceptives. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of pitavastatin. The effects of tezacaftor and ivacaftor (or ivacaftor alone) on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 9 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor and tezacaftor were substrates of CYP3A enzymes ( i.e. , CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Exposure to ivacaftor and tezacaftor will be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that tezacaftor is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1, and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Tezacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B3. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor (or ivacaftor alone) are shown in Table 10 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Tezacaftor A 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats and a 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of tezacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from tezacaftor was observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 50 and 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 and 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolites in males and females, respectively). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male and female Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice at tezacaftor doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. Tezacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. There were no effects on male or female fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral tezacaftor doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUC of tezacaftor and M1 metabolite). Ivacaftor Two-year studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of ivacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from ivacaftor was observed in mice or rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equivalent to 2 and 9 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 9 and 6 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg/kg/day. Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea, implantations, and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day were attributed to severe toxicity. No effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at \u2264100 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 4 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Dose Ranging : Dose selection for the clinical program primarily consisted of one double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-cohort trial which included 176 patients with CF (homozygous for the F508del mutation) 18 years of age and older with a screening ppFEV1\u226540. In the study, 34 and 106 patients, respectively, received tezacaftor at once-daily doses of 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg alone or in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h, and 33 patients received placebo. During the 28-day treatment period, dose-dependent increases in mean ppFEV 1 change from baseline were observed with tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor in general had a greater mean treatment effect than tezacaftor alone. No additional benefit was observed at tezacaftor doses greater than 100 mg daily. Efficacy : The efficacy of SYMDEKO in patients with CF aged 12 years and older was evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Trials1, 2, and 3). Trial 1 was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm study in patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. Trial 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, 8-week crossover study in patients with CF who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Mutations predicted to be responsive were selected for the study based on the clinical phenotype (pancreatic sufficiency), biomarker data (sweat chloride), and in vitro responsiveness to tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients were randomized to and received sequences of treatment that included SYMDEKO, ivacaftor, and placebo. Trial 3 was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm study in patients with CF who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second CFTR mutation predicted to be unresponsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Mutations predicted to be non-responsive were selected for the study based on biologic plausibility (mutation class), clinical phenotype (pancreatic insufficiency), biomarker data (sweat chloride), and in vitro testing to tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor. Patients in all trials continued on their standard-of-care CF therapies (e.g . , bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline) and were eligible to roll over into a 96-week open-label extension. Patients had a ppFEV 1 at screening between 40-90%. Patients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status such as Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had 2 or more abnormal liver function tests at screening (ALT, AST, AP, GGT \u22653 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin \u22652 \u00d7 ULN) or AST or ALT \u22655 \u00d7 ULN, were excluded from the trials. 14.1 Trial in Patients with CF Who Were Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the CFTR Gene (Trial 1) Trial 1 evaluated 504 patients (248 SYMDEKO, 256 placebo) with CF aged 12 years and older (mean age 26.3 years). The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline was 60.0% (range: 27.8% to 96.2%). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24. Treatment with SYMDEKO resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV 1 . The treatment difference between SYMDEKO and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 was 4.0 percentage points (95% CI: 3.1, 4.8; P< 0.0001). These changes persisted throughout the 24-week treatment period (Figure 1). Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV 1 , colonization with Pseudomonas , concomitant use of standard-of-care medications for CF, and geographic region. Key secondary efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24; number of pulmonary exacerbations from baseline through Week 24; absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 24, and absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF, such as cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing) from baseline through Week 24. For the purposes of this trial, a pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre-specified sino-pulmonary signs/symptoms. See Table 11 for a summary of key secondary outcomes in Trial 1. Table 11: Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses, Full Analysis Set (Trial 1) A hierarchical testing procedure was performed for primary and secondary endpoints vs placebo; at each step, P \u22640.05 and all previous tests also meeting this level of significance were required for statistical significance.

The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline was 62.3% (range: 34.6 to 93.5). Of the 244 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 146 patients had a splice mutation and 98 patients had a missense mutation as the second allele. 161 patients received SYMDEKO, 156 patients received ivacaftor, and 161 patients received placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean absolute change from study baseline in percent predicted FEV 1 averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score from study baseline averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. For the overall population, treatment with SYMDEKO compared to placebo resulted in significant improvement in ppFEV 1 (6.8 percentage points [95% CI: 5.7, 7.8]; P <0.0001) and CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (11.1 points (95% CI: 8.7, 13.6); P <0.0001). Treatment difference for ppFEV 1 between ivacaftor- and placebo-treated patients was 4.7 percentage points (95% CI: 3.7, 5.8; P <0.0001) and 2.1 percentage points (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P <0.0001) between SYMDEKO- and ivacaftor-treated patients, which were statistically significant. Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, baseline ppFEV 1 , sex, mutation class, colonization with Pseudomonas , concomitant use of standard-of-care medications for CF, and geographic region. Statistically significant improvements compared to placebo were also observed in the subgroup of patients with splice mutations and missense mutations (Table 12).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Transaminase (ALT or AST) Elevations and Monitoring Inform patients that elevation in liver tests has occurred in patients treated with SYMDEKO or with ivacaftor alone. Transaminases (ALT and AST) should be assessed prior to initiating SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. More frequent monitoring should be considered in patients with a history of transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis are possible with use of SYMDEKO. Inform patients of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including rash, hives, itching, facial swelling, tightness of the chest and wheezing. Advise patients to discontinue use of SYMDEKO immediately and contact their physician or go to the emergency department if these symptoms occur. Intracranial Hypertension Inform patients that intracranial hypertension has occurred in patients who received drugs containing the same or similar active ingredients as SYMDEKO. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider right away if they experience signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, including headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inducers and Inhibitors Ask patients to tell you all the medications they are taking including any herbal supplements or vitamins. Co-administration of SYMDEKO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended, as they may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of SYMDEKO. Adjustment of the dosage to one tablet of tezacaftor/ivacaftor twice a week, taken approximately 3 to 4 days apart is recommended when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. Dosage reduction to one tablet of tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor, taken on alternate days in the morning is recommended when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole. Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cataracts Inform patients that abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents receiving SYMDEKO or with ivacaftor alone. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations should be performed in pediatric patients initiating treatment with SYMDEKO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Inquire and/or assess whether patients have liver impairment. Adjust the dosage in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) to one tablet of tezacaftor/ivacaftor once daily in the morning and advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15); however, exposure is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, SYMDEKO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a dosage of one tablet of tezacaftor/ivacaftor once daily in the morning or less frequently. Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Driving and Operating Machinery Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving SYMDEKO, which could influence the ability to drive or operate machines [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Advise patients not to drive or operate machines if they experience dizziness until symptoms abate. Administration Inform patients that SYMDEKO is best absorbed by the body when taken with food that contains fat. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of SYMDEKO or ivacaftor: If 6 hours or less have passed since the time SYMDEKO is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of SYMDEKO with fat-containing food as soon as possible. If more than 6 hours have passed since the time SYMDEKO is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken, and the patient should resume the recommended dosing schedule. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider if they have questions."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION SYMDEKO (SIM-deh-koh) (tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets; ivacaftor tablets) for oral use What is SYMDEKO? SYMDEKO is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation, or who have at least one mutation in the CF gene that is responsive to treatment with SYMDEKO. Talk to your doctor to learn if you have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if SYMDEKO is safe and effective in children under 6 years of age. Before taking SYMDEKO, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had liver problems. are allergic to SYMDEKO or any ingredients in SYMDEKO. See the end of this patient information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in SYMDEKO. have kidney problems. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

Some examples of soft foods or liquids include pur\u00e9ed fruits or vegetables, flavored yogurt or pudding, applesauce, water, milk, breast milk, infant formula or juice. Food should be at room temperature or below. Each packet is for single use only. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be ingested during this period. Administration with Fat-Containing Food for ORKAMBI Tablets and Oral Granules A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just after dosing for all formulations. Examples of appropriate fat-containing foods include eggs, avocados, nuts, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, breast milk, infant formula, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. Missed Dose If a patient misses a dose and remembers the missed dose within 6 hours, the patient should take the dose with fat-containing food. If more than 6 hours elapsed after the recommended dosing time, the patient should skip that dose and resume the normal schedule for the following dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 2.2 Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Hepatic Impairment For dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment, refer to Table 2. Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, use with caution at a maximum dose of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening or less frequently, or 1 packet of oral granules once daily or less frequently in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] .

However, when initiating ORKAMBI in patients currently taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the ORKAMBI dosage for the first week of treatment based on age as follows [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]: 1 through 5 years of age: 1 packet of granules every other day 6 years of age and older: 1 tablet daily Following this one-week period, resume the recommended daily dosage. If ORKAMBI is interrupted for more than one-week and then re-initiated while taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the ORKAMBI dosage for the first week of treatment re-initiation based on age as follows: 1 through 5 years of age: 1 packet of granules every other day 6 years of age and older: 1 tablet daily Following this one-week period, resume the recommended daily dosage."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use in patients with advanced liver disease: ORKAMBI should be used with caution in these patients and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If ORKAMBI is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment and the dosage should be reduced. Liver function decompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 6.1 ) Liver-related events: Elevated transaminases (ALT/AST) have been observed in some cases associated with elevated bilirubin. Measure serum transaminases and bilirubin before initiating ORKAMBI, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Interrupt dosing in patients with ALT or AST >5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN with bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN. Following resolution, consider the benefits and risks of resuming dosing. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported with ORKAMBI in the postmarketing setting. Initiate appropriate therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.3 ) Intracranial hypertension: Intracranial hypertension (IH) has been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of ORKAMBI. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt ORKAMBI and refer for prompt medical evaluation. ( 5.4 ) Respiratory events: Chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal were observed more commonly during initiation of ORKAMBI. Clinical experience in patients with percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ) <40 is limited, and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended during initiation of therapy. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Blood pressure: Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients. Periodically monitor blood pressure in all patients. ( 5.6 , 6.1 ) Drug interactions: Use with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may decrease systemic exposure of the medicinal products and co-administration is not recommended. Hormonal contraceptives should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception and their use is associated with increased menstruation-related adverse reactions. Use with strong CYP3A inducers may diminish exposure of ivacaftor, which may diminish its effectiveness; therefore, co-administration is not recommended. ( 5.7 , 6.1 , 7 , 12.3 ) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ORKAMBI and ivacaftor, a component of ORKAMBI. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating ORKAMBI. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Use in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease Worsening of liver function, including hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Liver function decompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension while receiving ORKAMBI. Use ORKAMBI with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If ORKAMBI is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment and the dosage should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Liver-related Events Serious adverse reactions related to elevated transaminases have been reported in patients with CF receiving ORKAMBI. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. It is recommended that ALT, AST, and bilirubin be assessed prior to initiating ORKAMBI, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Patients who develop increased ALT, AST, or bilirubin should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST >5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) when not associated with elevated bilirubin. Dosing should also be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST elevations >3 \u00d7 ULN when associated with bilirubin elevations >2 \u00d7 ULN. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported in the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue ORKAMBI and institute appropriate therapy. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with ORKAMBI. 5.4 Intracranial Hypertension Cases of intracranial hypertension (IH) have been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of ORKAMBI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and potential vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt ORKAMBI and refer for prompt medical evaluation. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with ORKAMBI. Patients should be monitored until IH resolution and for recurrence. Patients with elevated vitamin A levels may be at increased risk. 5.5 Respiratory Events Respiratory events (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) were observed more commonly in patients during initiation of ORKAMBI compared to those who received placebo. These events have led to drug discontinuation and can be serious, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease (percent predicted FEV 1 <40). Clinical experience in patients with ppFEV 1 <40 is limited, and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended during initiation of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.6 Effect on Blood Pressure Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with ORKAMBI. Blood pressure should be monitored periodically in all patients being treated with ORKAMBI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.7 Drug Interactions Substrates of CYP3A Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Administration of ORKAMBI may decrease systemic exposure of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A, which may decrease therapeutic effect. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended. ORKAMBI may substantially decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing their effectiveness and increasing the incidence of menstruation-associated adverse reactions, e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual irregular (27% in women using hormonal contraceptives compared with 3% in women not using hormonal contraceptives). Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with ORKAMBI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7.3 , 7.11) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. Use of ORKAMBI with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, significantly reduces ivacaftor exposure, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of ORKAMBI. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.8 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ORKAMBI and ivacaftor, a component of ORKAMBI. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to ivacaftor cannot be excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating ORKAMBI treatment."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a complete list. ( 2.3 , 7 , 12.3 ) Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor 7.1 Inhibitors of CYP3A Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact the exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of lumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 150 mg every 12 hours (the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy). Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking ORKAMBI. However, when initiating ORKAMBI in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the ORKAMBI dosage as recommended for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady-state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, continue with the recommended daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. telithromycin, clarithromycin. No dosage adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. 7.2 Inducers of CYP3A Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal effect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. This may reduce the effectiveness of ORKAMBI. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dosage adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. Potential for Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs 7.3 CYP3A Substrates Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration of lumacaftor with ivacaftor, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased ivacaftor exposure by approximately 80%. Administration of ORKAMBI may decrease systemic exposure of medicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A, thereby decreasing the therapeutic effect of the medicinal product. Co-administration of ORKAMBI is not recommended with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] such as: Benzodiazepines : midazolam, triazolam (consider an alternative to these benzodiazepines). Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus (avoid the use of ORKAMBI). 7.4 CYP2B6 and CYP2C Substrates In vitro studies suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro . Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates. 7.5 Digoxin and Other P-gp Substrates Based on in vitro results which showed P-gp inhibition and pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) activation, lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. Additionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with P-gp substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates. Monitor the serum concentration of digoxin and titrate the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.6 Anti-allergics and Systemic Corticosteroids ORKAMBI may decrease the exposure of montelukast, which may reduce its efficacy. No dosage adjustment for montelukast is recommended. Employ appropriate clinical monitoring, as is reasonable, when co-administered with ORKAMBI. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of prednisone and methylprednisolone. A higher dose of these systemic corticosteroids may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.7 Antibiotics Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may decrease the exposure of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and telithromycin, which may reduce the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Consider an alternative to these antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. 7.8 Antifungals Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI with these antifungals is not recommended. Monitor patients closely for breakthrough fungal infections if such drugs are necessary. Consider an alternative such as fluconazole. 7.9 Anti-inflammatories Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of ibuprofen. A higher dose of ibuprofen may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.10 Antidepressants Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline. A higher dose of these antidepressants may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.11 Hormonal Contraceptives ORKAMBI may decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing the effectiveness. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with ORKAMBI. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI with hormonal contraceptives increased the menstrual abnormality events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. 7.12 Oral Hypoglycemics Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of repaglinide and may alter the exposure of sulfonylurea. A dosage adjustment may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. No dosage adjustment is recommended for metformin. 7.13 Proton Pump Inhibitors, H 2 Blockers, Antacids ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole, and may alter the exposure of ranitidine. A dose adjustment may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. No dose adjustment is recommended for calcium carbonate antacid. 7.14 Warfarin ORKAMBI may alter the exposure of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) when warfarin co-administration with ORKAMBI is required. 7.15 Concomitant Drugs That Do Not Need Dosage Adjustment No dosage adjustment of ORKAMBI or concomitant drug is recommended when ORKAMBI is given with the following: azithromycin, aztreonam, budesonide, ceftazidime, cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, colistimethate, colistin, dornase alfa, fluticasone, ipratropium, levofloxacin, pancreatin, pancrelipase, salbutamol, salmeterol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tiotropium, and tobramycin. Based on the metabolism and route of elimination, ORKAMBI is not expected to impact the exposure of these drugs."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Use in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver-related Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Respiratory Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Effect on Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] The most common adverse reactions to ORKAMBI (occurring in \u22655% of patients with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene) were dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, respiration abnormal, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, rash, flatulence, rhinorrhea, influenza. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety profile of ORKAMBI is based on the pooled data from 1108 patients with CF aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who received at least one dose of study drug in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials, each with 24 weeks of treatment (Trials 1 and 2). In addition, the following clinical trials have been conducted: A 24-week, open-label trial (Trial 3) in 58 patients with CF aged 6 through 11 years homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A 24-week, placebo-controlled trial (Trial 4) in 204 patients aged 6 through 11 years homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A 24-week, open-label trial (Trial 5) in 46 patients aged 12 years and older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and with advanced lung disease (ppFEV 1 <40). A 24-week, open-label trial (Trial 6) in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A 24-week, open-label trial (Trial 7) in 46 patients aged 1 through 2 years homozygous for the F508del - CFTR mutation. Of the 1108 patients, in the pooled analyses of Trial 1 and Trial 2, 49% were female and 99% were Caucasian; 369 patients received ORKAMBI every 12 hours and 370 patients received placebo. The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to adverse events was 5% for patients treated with ORKAMBI and 2% for patients who received placebo. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in patients treated with ORKAMBI included pneumonia, hemoptysis, cough, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and transaminase elevations. These occurred in 1% or less of patients. Table 3 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients with CF aged 12 years and older treated with ORKAMBI who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene that also occurred at a higher rate than in patients who received placebo in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Table 3: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in \u22655% of ORKAMBI-Treated Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Who are Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the CFTR Gene in 2 Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Clinical Trials of 24 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) ORKAMBI N=369 (%) Placebo N=370 (%) Dyspnea 48 (13) 29 (8) Nasopharyngitis 48 (13) 40 (11) Nausea 46 (13) 28 (8) Diarrhea 45 (12) 31 (8) Upper respiratory tract infection 37 (10) 20 (5) Fatigue 34 (9) 29 (8) Respiration abnormal 32 (9) 22 (6) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 27 (7) 20 (5) Rash 25 (7) 7 (2) Flatulence 24 (7) 11 (3) Rhinorrhea 21 (6) 15 (4) Influenza 19 (5) 8 (2) The safety profile from two pediatric trials in CF patients aged 6 through 11 years who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, a 24-week, open-label, multicenter safety trial in 58 patients (Trial 3) and a 24-week, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (Trial 4) in 204 patients (103 received lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours and 101 received placebo), was similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 2. Adverse reactions that are not listed in Table 3, and that occurred in \u22655% of lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients with an incidence of \u22653% higher than placebo included: productive cough (17.5% vs 5.9%), nasal congestion (16.5% vs 7.9%), headache (12.6% vs 8.9%), abdominal pain upper (12.6% vs 6.9%), and sputum increased (10.7% vs 2.0%). In a 24-week, open-label, multicenter, study in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years with CF who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (Trial 6) the safety profile was similar to that observed in studies in patients aged 6 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . In a 24-week, open-label, multicenter, study in 46 patients aged 1 through 2 years with CF who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (Trial 7) the safety profile was similar to that observed in studies in patients aged 2 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Additional information on selected adverse reactions from trials is detailed below: Description of Selected Adverse Drug Reactions Liver-related Adverse Reactions In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN elevations were similar between patients treated with ORKAMBI and those who received placebo. Three patients who received ORKAMBI had liver-related serious adverse reactions, including two reported as transaminase elevations and one as hepatic encephalopathy, compared to none in the placebo group. Of these three, one had elevated transaminases (>3 \u00d7 ULN) associated with bilirubin elevation >2 \u00d7 ULN. Following discontinuation or interruption of ORKAMBI, transaminases decreased to <3 \u00d7 ULN. Among six patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received ORKAMBI, worsening liver function with increased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event occurred within five days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of ORKAMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] . During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 58 patients aged 6 through 11 years (Trial 3), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN was 5%, 9%, and 19%. No patients had total bilirubin levels >2 \u00d7 ULN. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor dosing was maintained or successfully resumed after interruption in all patients with transaminase elevations, except one patient who discontinued treatment permanently. During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in 204 patients aged 6 through 11 years (Trial 4), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN was 1%, 5%, and 13% in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, and 2%, 3%, and 8% in the placebo-treated patients. No patients had total bilirubin levels >2 \u00d7 ULN. Two patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and two patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment permanently due to transaminase elevations. During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years (Trial 6), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN was 8.3% (5/60), 11.7% (7/60), and 15.0% (9/60). No patients had total bilirubin levels >2 \u00d7 ULN. Three patients discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment permanently due to transaminase elevations. During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 46 patients aged 1 through 2 years (Trial 7), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN was 2.2% (1/46), 4.3% (2/46), and 10.9% (5/46), respectively. No patients had total bilirubin levels >2 \u00d7 ULN. One patient discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment permanently due to transaminase elevations. Respiratory Adverse Reactions In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of respiratory symptom-related adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) was more common in patients treated with ORKAMBI (22%) compared to patients who received placebo (14%). The incidence of these adverse reactions was more common in patients treated with ORKAMBI with lower pre-treatment FEV 1 . In patients treated with ORKAMBI, the majority of the events began during the first week of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 46 patients aged 12 years and older (Trial 5) with advanced lung disease (ppFEV 1 <40) [mean ppFEV 1 29.1 at baseline (range: 18.3 to 42.0)], the incidence of respiratory symptom-related adverse reactions was 65% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 3) in 58 patients aged 6 through 11 years (mean baseline ppFEV 1 was 91.4), the incidence of respiratory symptom-related adverse reactions was 3% (2/58). During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (Trial 4) in patients aged 6 through 11 years [mean ppFEV 1 89.8 at baseline (range: 48.6 to 119.6)], the incidence of respiratory symptom-related adverse reactions was 11% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients and 9% in placebo patients. A decline in ppFEV 1 at initiation of therapy was observed during serial post-dose spirometry assessments. The absolute change from pre-dose at 4-6 hours post-dose was -7.7 on Day 1 and -1.3 on Day 15 in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients. The post-dose decline was resolved by Week 16. Menstrual Abnormalities In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormality adverse reactions (e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual irregular) was more common in female patients treated with ORKAMBI (10%) compared to placebo (2%). These events occurred more frequently in the subset of female patients treated with ORKAMBI who were using hormonal contraceptives (27%) compared to those not using hormonal contraceptives (3%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7.11) ] . Increased Blood Pressure In Trials 1 and 2, adverse reactions related to increases in blood pressure (e.g., hypertension, blood pressure increased) were reported in 1.1% (4/369) of patients treated with ORKAMBI and in no patients who received placebo. The proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value >140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.6% and 2.2% in patients treated with ORKAMBI, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ORKAMBI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : liver function decompensation including liver failure leading to death in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports on use of ORKAMBI or its individual components, lumacaftor or ivacaftor, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lumacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse effects on fetal development at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 8 (rats) and 5 (rabbits) times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse effects on fetal development at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 7 (rats) and 45 (rabbits) times the exposure at the MRHD. No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of either lumacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 8 and 5 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively (see Data ) . There are no animal reproduction studies with concomitant administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Lumacaftor In an embryo-fetal development (EFD) study, pregnant rats were administered lumacaftor at oral doses of 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-17. Lumacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 8 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered lumacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-19. Lumacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased body weight, decreased food consumption, and clinical signs was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day without any adverse fetal effects. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats administered lumacaftor at 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20, lumacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 8 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of lumacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Ivacaftor In an EFD study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-17. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., decreased mean body weight and body weight gain) was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 7 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in fetal body weights at a maternal dose of 200 mg/kg/day (7 times the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-19. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 45 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., death, decreased food consumption, decreased mean body weight and body weight gain, decreased clinical condition, abortions) was observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 15 times the MRHD). In a pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20. Ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of lumacaftor or ivacaftor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal lactation data may not reliably predict levels in human milk (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ORKAMBI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ORKAMBI or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Lumacaftor Lacteal excretion of lumacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-lumacaftor administered 9 to 11 days postpartum to lactating mothers (dams). Exposure (AUC 0-24h ) values for lumacaftor in milk were approximately 40% of plasma levels. Ivacaftor Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating mothers (dams). Exposure (AUC 0-24h ) values for ivacaftor in milk were approximately 1.5 times higher than plasma levels. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ORKAMBI may decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing the effectiveness. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with ORKAMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7.11) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in pediatric patients aged one year and older have been established. Use of ORKAMBI in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ORKAMBI in patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] with additional data as follows: Extrapolation of efficacy in patients aged 12 years and older homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene to pediatric patients aged 1 through 11 years with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar drug exposure levels in patients aged 12 years and older and in patients aged 1 through 11 years [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety data were obtained from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 58 patients aged 6 through 11 years, mean age 9 years (Trial 3) and a 24-week, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in 204 patients aged 6 through 11 years (Trial 4). Trial 3 evaluated subjects with a screening ppFEV 1 \u226540 [mean ppFEV 1 91.4 at baseline (range: 55 to 122.7)]. Trial 4 evaluated subjects with a screening ppFEV 1 \u226570 [mean ppFEV 1 89.8 at baseline (range: 48.6 to 119.6)]. The safety profile of ORKAMBI in pediatric patients 6 through 11 years of age was similar to that in patients aged 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In Trial 3, spirometry (ppFEV 1 ) was assessed as a planned safety endpoint. The within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 24 was 2.5 percentage points. At the Week 26 safety follow-up visit (following a planned discontinuation) ppFEV 1 was also assessed. The within-group LS mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from Week 24 at Week 26 was -3.2 percentage points. Additional safety data were obtained from Trial 6, a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years at screening (mean age at baseline 3.7 years). The safety profile in Trial 6 was similar to that in patients aged 6 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Additional safety data were obtained from Trial 7, a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 46 patients aged 1 to 2 years at screening (mean age at baseline 18.1 months). The safety profile in Trial 7 was similar to that in patients aged 2 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Safety was evaluated in a 96-week open-label clinical trial (Trial 8) in 52 patients (39 rolled over from Trial 7 and 13 ORKAMBI na\u00efve) aged 1 to 2 years. Adverse reactions from trial 8 were generally similar to those reported in Trial 7. The safety and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in patients with CF younger than 1 year of age have not been established. Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ORKAMBI and ivacaftor, a component of ORKAMBI. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to ivacaftor cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile toxicology study in which ivacaftor was administered to rats from post-natal days 7 to 35, cataracts were observed at all dose levels, ranging from 0.3 to 2 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at oral doses of 10-50 mg/kg/day). This finding has not been observed in older animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use CF is largely a disease of children and young adults. Clinical trials of ORKAMBI did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). A dose reduction to 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening is recommended for patients aged 6 years and older with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). A dose reduction to 1 packet of oral granules in the morning daily and 1 packet of oral granules in the evening every other day is recommended for patients aged 1 to 5 years old with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, use with caution at a maximum dose of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening or less frequently, or 1 packet of oral granules once daily or less frequently in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment ORKAMBI has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended while using ORKAMBI in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u226430 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease. 8.8 Patients with Severe Lung Dysfunction The Phase 3 trials (Trials 1 and 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ) included 29 patients receiving ORKAMBI with ppFEV 1 <40 at baseline. The treatment effect in this subgroup was comparable to that observed in patients with ppFEV 1 \u226540. 8.9 Patients After Organ Transplantation ORKAMBI has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Use in transplanted patients is not recommended due to potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports on use of ORKAMBI or its individual components, lumacaftor or ivacaftor, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lumacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse effects on fetal development at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 8 (rats) and 5 (rabbits) times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse effects on fetal development at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 7 (rats) and 45 (rabbits) times the exposure at the MRHD. No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of either lumacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 8 and 5 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively (see Data ) . There are no animal reproduction studies with concomitant administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Lumacaftor In an embryo-fetal development (EFD) study, pregnant rats were administered lumacaftor at oral doses of 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-17. Lumacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 8 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered lumacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-19. Lumacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased body weight, decreased food consumption, and clinical signs was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day without any adverse fetal effects. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats administered lumacaftor at 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20, lumacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 8 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of lumacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Ivacaftor In an EFD study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-17. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., decreased mean body weight and body weight gain) was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (5 and 7 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in fetal body weights at a maternal dose of 200 mg/kg/day (7 times the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7-19. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 45 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., death, decreased food consumption, decreased mean body weight and body weight gain, decreased clinical condition, abortions) was observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 15 times the MRHD).

Ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. The F508del mutation results in protein misfolding, causing a defect in cellular processing and trafficking that targets the protein for degradation and therefore reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface is less stable and has low channel-open probability (defective gating activity) compared to wild-type CFTR protein. Lumacaftor improves the conformational stability of F508del-CFTR, resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both lumacaftor and ivacaftor act directly on the CFTR protein in primary human bronchial epithelial cultures and other cell lines harboring the F508del-CFTR mutation to increase the quantity, stability, and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride ion transport. In vitro responses do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response or clinical benefit. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sweat Chloride Evaluation Changes in sweat chloride in response to relevant doses of lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and older either homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation. In that trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del ) completed dosing with lumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an additional 28 days and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del ) completed dosing with placebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to Day 28 compared to placebo was -8.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to Day 56 compared to placebo was -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were also evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 3) in 58 patients with CF, aged 6 through 11 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for 24 weeks. Patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor had a reduction in sweat chloride at Day 15 that was sustained through Week 24. The within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -20.4 mmol/L at Day 15 and -24.8 mmol/L at Week 24. In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The within-group LS mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 21.3 mmol/L. Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were also evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 6) in 60 patients with CF, aged 2 through 5 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received either lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 hours or lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 that was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was \u201331.7 mmol/L (95% CI: -35.7, -27.6) at Week 24. In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was an increase of 33.0 mmol/L (95% CI: 28.9, 37.1; P <0.0001). Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 7) in 46 patients with CF, aged 1 through 2 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg (patient weighing 7 kg to <9 kg at screening), lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg (patient weighing 9 kg to <14 kg at screening), lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg (patient weighing \u226514 kg at screening), every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 which was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -29.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -34.8, -23.4). In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 27.3 mmol/L (95% CI: 22.3, 32.3). There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (ppFEV 1 ). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (400 mg moxifloxacin), parallel, thorough QT study in 168 healthy subjects. No meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h dose groups. A maximum decrease in mean heart rate of up to 8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. In Trials 1 and 2, a similar decrease in heart rate was observed in patients during initiation of ORKAMBI (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The exposure (AUC) of lumacaftor is approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers compared to exposure in patients with CF. The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. After twice daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of treatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor. The steady-state exposure of ivacaftor is lower than that of Day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor.

(h) AUC 0-12h (\u03bcg\u2219h/mL) Lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ Ivacaftor 250 mg q12h Lumacaftor 25.0 (7.96) 25.2 (9.94) 198 (64.8) Ivacaftor 0.602 (0.304) 9.34 (3.81) 3.66 (2.25) Absorption When a single dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor was administered with fat-containing foods, lumacaftor exposure was approximately 2 times higher and ivacaftor exposure was approximately 3 times higher than when taken in a fasting state. Following multiple oral dose administration of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased proportional to dose over the range of 200 mg every 24 hours to 400 mg every 12 hours. The median (range) t max of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. Following multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The median (range) t max of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. Distribution Lumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral administration of 200 mg every 24 hours for 28 days to patients with CF in a fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volumes of distribution was 86.0 (69.8) L. Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Elimination The half-life of lumacaftor is approximately 26 hours in patients with CF. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor was estimated to be 2.38 L/hr (29.4%) for patients with CF. The half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately 9 hours in healthy subjects. The typical CL/F (CV), of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated to be 25.1 L/hr (40.5%) for patients with CF. Metabolism Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolized in humans with the majority of lumacaftor excreted unchanged in the feces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolized via oxidation and glucuronidation. Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. Excretion Following oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged in the feces. There was minimal elimination of lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0.18% as unchanged parent). Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. There was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The following conclusions about exposures between adults and the pediatric population are based on population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses: Table 5: Mean (SD) Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group Age Group Weight Dose Mean Lumacaftor (SD) The mean lumacaftor (SD) AUC ss is comparable to the mean AUC ss in patients aged 12 years and older administered ORKAMBI tablets. AUC ss (\u00b5g\u2219h/mL) Mean Ivacaftor (SD) The mean ivacaftor (SD) AUC ss is comparable to the mean AUC ss in patients aged 12 years and older administered ORKAMBI tablets.

Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for lumacaftor and ivacaftor between males and females. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ORKAMBI in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had approximately 50% higher exposures (AUC 0-12h ) and approximately 30% higher C max for both lumacaftor and ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10 to 15) receiving ORKAMBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration of lumacaftor with ivacaftor, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased ivacaftor exposure by 80%. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as monotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is strong CYP3A induction [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Based on in vitro results which showed P-gp inhibition and PXR activation, lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. A clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with P-gp substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . In vitro studies suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro . In vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Lumacaftor exposure is not affected by concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors. Exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor is reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of lumacaftor and ivacaftor are shown in Table 6 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. The F508del mutation results in protein misfolding, causing a defect in cellular processing and trafficking that targets the protein for degradation and therefore reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface is less stable and has low channel-open probability (defective gating activity) compared to wild-type CFTR protein. Lumacaftor improves the conformational stability of F508del-CFTR, resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both lumacaftor and ivacaftor act directly on the CFTR protein in primary human bronchial epithelial cultures and other cell lines harboring the F508del-CFTR mutation to increase the quantity, stability, and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride ion transport. In vitro responses do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response or clinical benefit."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sweat Chloride Evaluation Changes in sweat chloride in response to relevant doses of lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and older either homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation. In that trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del ) completed dosing with lumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an additional 28 days and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del ) completed dosing with placebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to Day 28 compared to placebo was -8.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to Day 56 compared to placebo was -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were also evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 3) in 58 patients with CF, aged 6 through 11 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for 24 weeks. Patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor had a reduction in sweat chloride at Day 15 that was sustained through Week 24. The within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -20.4 mmol/L at Day 15 and -24.8 mmol/L at Week 24. In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The within-group LS mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 21.3 mmol/L. Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were also evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 6) in 60 patients with CF, aged 2 through 5 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received either lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 hours or lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 that was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was \u201331.7 mmol/L (95% CI: -35.7, -27.6) at Week 24. In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was an increase of 33.0 mmol/L (95% CI: 28.9, 37.1; P <0.0001). Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 7) in 46 patients with CF, aged 1 through 2 years (homozygous for F508del ) who received lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg (patient weighing 7 kg to <9 kg at screening), lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg (patient weighing 9 kg to <14 kg at screening), lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg (patient weighing \u226514 kg at screening), every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 which was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -29.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -34.8, -23.4). In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 27.3 mmol/L (95% CI: 22.3, 32.3). There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (ppFEV 1 ). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (400 mg moxifloxacin), parallel, thorough QT study in 168 healthy subjects. No meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h dose groups. A maximum decrease in mean heart rate of up to 8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. In Trials 1 and 2, a similar decrease in heart rate was observed in patients during initiation of ORKAMBI (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The exposure (AUC) of lumacaftor is approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers compared to exposure in patients with CF. The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. After twice daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of treatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor. The steady-state exposure of ivacaftor is lower than that of Day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor. Table 4: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor at Steady-State in Subjects with CF Drug C max (\u03bcg/mL) t \u00bd Based on lumacaftor 200 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h studied in healthy subjects.

Following multiple oral dose administration of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased proportional to dose over the range of 200 mg every 24 hours to 400 mg every 12 hours. The median (range) t max of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. Following multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The median (range) t max of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. Distribution Lumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral administration of 200 mg every 24 hours for 28 days to patients with CF in a fed state, the mean (\u00b1SD) for apparent volumes of distribution was 86.0 (69.8) L. Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Elimination The half-life of lumacaftor is approximately 26 hours in patients with CF. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor was estimated to be 2.38 L/hr (29.4%) for patients with CF. The half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately 9 hours in healthy subjects. The typical CL/F (CV), of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated to be 25.1 L/hr (40.5%) for patients with CF. Metabolism Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolized in humans with the majority of lumacaftor excreted unchanged in the feces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolized via oxidation and glucuronidation. Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. Excretion Following oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged in the feces. There was minimal elimination of lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0.18% as unchanged parent). Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. There was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The following conclusions about exposures between adults and the pediatric population are based on population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses: Table 5: Mean (SD) Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor Exposure by Age Group Age Group Weight Dose Mean Lumacaftor (SD) The mean lumacaftor (SD) AUC ss is comparable to the mean AUC ss in patients aged 12 years and older administered ORKAMBI tablets. AUC ss (\u00b5g\u2219h/mL) Mean Ivacaftor (SD) The mean ivacaftor (SD) AUC ss is comparable to the mean AUC ss in patients aged 12 years and older administered ORKAMBI tablets. AUC ss (\u00b5g\u2219h/mL) Patients aged 1 to <2 years 7 kg to <9 kg lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg every 12 hours. 234 7.98 9 kg to <14 kg lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 hours. 191 (40.6) 5.35 (1.61) \u226514 kg lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 hours. 116 5.82 Patients aged 2 through 5 years <14 kg lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 hours. 180 (45.5) 5.92 (4.61) \u226514 kg lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 hours. 217 (48.6) 5.90 (1.93) Patients aged 6 through 11 years - lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours. 203 (57.4) 5.26 (3.08) Patients aged 12 to <18 years - lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours. 241 (61.4) 3.90 (1.56) Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of ORKAMBI was evaluated using a population PK analyses of data from clinical studies of lumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor. Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for lumacaftor and ivacaftor between males and females. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ORKAMBI in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had approximately 50% higher exposures (AUC 0-12h ) and approximately 30% higher C max for both lumacaftor and ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10 to 15) receiving ORKAMBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration of lumacaftor with ivacaftor, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased ivacaftor exposure by 80%. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as monotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is strong CYP3A induction [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Based on in vitro results which showed P-gp inhibition and PXR activation, lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. A clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with P-gp substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . In vitro studies suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro . In vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Lumacaftor exposure is not affected by concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors. Exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor is reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of lumacaftor and ivacaftor are shown in Table 6 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Lumacaftor A two-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats and a 26-week study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice were conducted to assess carcinogenic potential of lumacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at lumacaftor oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 and 13 times the MRHD on a lumacaftor AUC basis in males and females, respectively). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in Tg.rasH2 mice at lumacaftor oral doses up to 1500 and 2000 mg/kg/day in female and male mice, respectively. Lumacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Lumacaftor had no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 and 8 times, respectively, the MRHD on a lumacaftor AUC basis). Ivacaftor Two-year studies were conducted in mice and rats to assess carcinogenic potential of ivacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice and rats at ivacaftor oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equivalent to 3 and 10 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 15 and 7 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg/kg/day. Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea, implantations, and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day were attributed to severe toxicity. No effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at an oral dose of \u2264100 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 and 5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Dose Ranging Dose ranging for the clinical program consisted primarily of one double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-cohort trial which included 97 Caucasian patients with CF (homozygous for the F508del mutation) aged 18 years and older with a screening ppFEV 1 \u226540. In the trial, 76 patients (homozygous for the F508del mutation) were randomized to receive lumacaftor alone at once daily doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg or 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and 27 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation) received placebo. During the initial 28-day lumacaftor monotherapy period, treatment with lumacaftor demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in ppFEV 1 compared to placebo. Changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in ppFEV 1 compared to placebo were 0.24, -1.4, -2.7, and -4.6 for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in ppFEV 1 compared to placebo were 3.8, 2.7, 5.6, and 4.2, respectively. Sweat chloride was also assessed in this trial. Following the initial 28 days of lumacaftor monotherapy, the changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -4.9, -8.3, -6.1, and -8.2 mmol/L for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -5.0, -9.8, -9.5, and -11 mmol/L, respectively. These data supported the evaluation of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h (ORKAMBI) and lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in the confirmatory trials. Confirmatory The efficacy of ORKAMBI in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in 1108 clinically stable patients with CF of whom 369 patients received ORKAMBI twice daily. Trial 1 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.1 years) with ppFEV 1 at screening between 40-90 [mean ppFEV 1 60.7 at baseline (range: 31.1 to 94.0)]. Trial 2 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 years) with ppFEV 1 at screening between 40-90 [mean ppFEV 1 60.5 at baseline (range: 31.3 to 99.8)]. Patients with a history of colonization with organisms such as Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had 3 or more abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, GGT \u22653 \u00d7 the ULN or total bilirubin \u22652 \u00d7 the ULN) were excluded. Patients in both trials were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ORKAMBI (lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; or lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) or placebo. Patients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 24, assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24. In both trials, treatment with ORKAMBI resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV 1 . The treatment difference between ORKAMBI and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 24 (assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24) was 2.6 percentage points [95% CI (1.2, 4.0)] in Trial 1 ( P =0.0003) and 3.0 percentage points [95% CI (1.6, 4.4)] in Trial 2 ( P <0.0001). These changes persisted throughout the 24-week treatment period (see Figure 1 ). Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex, and geographic region. Figure 1. Absolute Change From Baseline at Each Visit in Percent Predicted FEV 1 in Trial 1 and Trial 2. LS = Least Squares; q12h = every 12 hours Key secondary efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 24, assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24; absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24; absolute change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain score at Week 24, a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF such as cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing; proportion of patients achieving \u22655% relative change from baseline in ppFEV 1 using the average of Week 16 and Week 24; and number of pulmonary exacerbations through Week 24. For the purposes of these trials, a pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre-specified sino-pulmonary signs/symptoms.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Advanced Liver Disease Inform patients that worsening of liver function, including hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with advanced liver disease occurred in some patients treated with ORKAMBI. Liver function decompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension while receiving ORKAMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Abnormalities in Liver Function and Testing Inform patients that abnormalities in liver function have occurred in patients treated with ORKAMBI. Blood tests to measure transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin will be performed prior to initiating ORKAMBI, every 3 months during the first year of therapy, and annually thereafter. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms consistent with hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis are possible with use of ORKAMBI. Inform patients of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including rash, hives, itching, facial swelling, tightness of the chest and wheezing. Advise patients to discontinue use of ORKAMBI immediately and contact their physician or go to the emergency department if these symptoms occur. Intracranial Hypertension Inform patients that intracranial hypertension has occurred with the use of ORKAMBI. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider right away if they experience signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, including headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Respiratory Events Inform patients that chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal were more common during initiation of ORKAMBI therapy, especially in patients with advanced lung disease and to contact their healthcare provider if they develop any of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Effect on Blood Pressure Inform patients that increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with ORKAMBI and that periodic monitoring of their blood pressure during treatment is recommended and to contact their healthcare provider if they develop elevated blood pressure or notice elevations in pre-existing high blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers Advise patients to inform their healthcare providers of all concomitant medications, herbal and dietary supplements. Advise patients to avoid grapefruit products during the first week after treatment initiation with ORKAMBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Instruct post-menarchal patients including females of reproductive potential on alternative methods of birth control because hormonal contraceptives should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception. ORKAMBI may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives and there is an increased incidence of menstruation-related adverse reactions when co-administered with ORKAMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Drug Interactions (7.11) ] . Cataracts Inform patients that abnormalities of the eye lens (cataract) have been noted in some children and adolescents receiving ORKAMBI. Advise pediatric patients and their caregivers that they will receive ophthalmological examinations before initiating and during ORKAMBI treatment. Advise pediatric patients and/or their caregivers to contact their healthcare provider if they experience visual changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Administration Inform patients that ORKAMBI should be taken with fat-containing food. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples of fat-containing foods include eggs, avocados, nuts, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, breast milk, infant formula, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Inform patients and caregivers that ORKAMBI oral granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and completely consumed to ensure delivery of the entire dose. Food or liquid should be at or below room temperature. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be consumed during this period. Some examples of appropriate soft foods or liquids may include pur\u00e9ed fruits or vegetables, flavored yogurt or pudding, applesauce, water, milk, breast milk, infant formula or juice. Inform patients that if a dose is missed and they remember the missed dose within 6 hours, the patients should take the dose with fat-containing food. If more than 6 hours elapsed after the usual dosing time, the patients should skip that dose and resume the normal schedule for the following dose. Patients should be informed not to take a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."

Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation and death have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease taking TRIKAFTA, in both clinical trials and the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of TRIKAFTA . Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating TRIKAFTA. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Interrupt TRIKAFTA for significant elevations in liver function tests or in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. Consider referral to a hepatologist. Follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve, resume treatment only if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk. Closer monitoring is advised after resuming TRIKAFTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). TRIKAFTA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). If used, use with caution at a reduced dosage and monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced liver injury and liver failure : TRIKAFTA can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating and throughout treatment with TRIKAFTA. Interrupt TRIKAFTA in the event of significant elevations in liver function tests or signs or symptoms of liver injury. TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). TRIKAFTA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 5.1 , 6 , 8.7 , 12.3 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported with TRIKAFTA in the postmarketing setting. Initiate appropriate therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.2 ) Intracranial hypertension : Intracranial hypertension (IH) has been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of TRIKAFTA. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt TRIKAFTA and refer for prompt medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) Use with CYP3A inducers : Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) significantly decrease ivacaftor exposure and are expected to decrease elexacaftor and tezacaftor exposure, which may reduce TRIKAFTA efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use is not recommended. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Cataracts : Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor-containing regimens. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating TRIKAFTA treatment. ( 5.6 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure TRIKAFTA can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation and death have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease taking TRIKAFTA, in both clinical trials and the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of TRIKAFTA. Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating TRIKAFTA. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Interrupt TRIKAFTA in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include: Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g., ALT or AST >5 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN with bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN) Clinical symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites). Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume TRIKAFTA treatment with close monitoring. TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). TRIKAFTA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, use with caution at a reduced dosage and monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported in the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue TRIKAFTA and institute appropriate therapy. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with TRIKAFTA . 5.3 Intracranial Hypertension Cases of intracranial hypertension (IH) have been reported in the postmarketing setting with the use of TRIKAFTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and potential vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. If an unusual headache or visual disturbances occur during treatment, and IH is suspected, interrupt TRIKAFTA and refer for prompt medical evaluation. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to resume treatment with TRIKAFTA. Patients should be monitored until IH resolution and for recurrence. Patients with elevated vitamin A levels may be at increased risk. 5.4 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposure to elexacaftor and tezacaftor are expected to decrease by the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of TRIKAFTA. Therefore, concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.5 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inhibitors Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are increased when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Therefore, the dose of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.6 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with TRIKAFTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to TRIKAFTA (\u22655% of patients and at a frequency higher than placebo by \u22651%) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, alanine aminotransferase increased, nasal congestion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, influenza, sinusitis, blood bilirubin increased and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis with at Least One F508del Mutation The safety profile of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF with at least one F508del mutation is based on data from 510 patients aged 12 years and older in two double-blind, controlled trials of 24 weeks and 4 weeks treatment duration (Trials 1 and 2, respectively). Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open-label extension safety study (up to 96 weeks of TRIKAFTA). In the two controlled trials, a total of 257 patients aged 12 years and older received at least one dose of TRIKAFTA. In Trial 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse events was 1% for TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 0% for placebo-treated patients. In Trial 1, serious adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in TRIKAFTA-treated patients compared to placebo were rash (1% vs <1%) and influenza (1% vs 0%). There were no deaths. Table 4 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients and higher than placebo by \u22651% in the 24-week, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (Trial 1). Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22655% of TRIKAFTA-Treated Patients and Higher than Placebo by \u22651% in Trial 1 Adverse Reactions TRIKAFTA N=202 n (%) Placebo N=201 n (%) Headache 35 (17) 30 (15) Upper respiratory tract infection Includes upper respiratory tract infection and viral upper respiratory tract infection. 32 (16) 25 (12) Abdominal pain Includes abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower. 29 (14) 18 (9) Diarrhea 26 (13) 14 (7) Rash Includes rash, rash generalized, rash erythematous, rash macular, rash pruritic. 21 (10) 10 (5) Alanine aminotransferase increased 20 (10) 7 (3) Nasal congestion 19 (9) 15 (7) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 19 (9) 9 (4) Aspartate aminotransferase increased 19 (9) 4 (2) Rhinorrhea 17 (8) 6 (3) Rhinitis 15 (7) 11 (5) Influenza 14 (7) 3 (1) Sinusitis 11 (5) 8 (4) Blood bilirubin increased 10 (5) 2 (1) Additional adverse reactions that occurred in TRIKAFTA-treated patients at a frequency of 2% to <5% and higher than placebo by \u22651% include the following: flatulence, abdominal distension, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, urinary tract infection, c-reactive protein increased, hypoglycemia, dizziness, dysmenorrhea, acne, eczema and pruritus. In addition, the following clinical trials have also been conducted [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14) ]: a 24-week, open-label trial in 66 patients with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years who were either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation, and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trial 3). a 24-week, open-label trial in 75 patients with CF aged 2 to less than 6 years. Patients who had at least one F508del mutation or a mutation known to be responsive to TRIKAFTA were eligible for the study (Trial 4). The safety profile for the CF patients enrolled in Trials 2, 3, and 4 was consistent to that observed in Trial 1. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis with at Least One Qualifying Non- F508del Mutation The safety of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF with at least one non- F508del mutation is based on data from 307 patients aged 6 years and older with at least one qualifying non- F508del CFTR mutation that was TRIKAFTA-responsive. Trial 5 was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial for a 24-week treatment duration in which 205 patients received at least one dose of TRIKAFTA. Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open-label extension safety study. In Trial 5, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse reactions was 2% for TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 0% for placebo-treated patients. Table 5 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients and higher than placebo by \u22651% in the 24-week, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (Trial 5). Table 5: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22655% of TRIKAFTA-Treated Patients and Higher than Placebo by \u22651% in Trial 5 Adverse Reactions TRIKAFTA N=205 n (%) Placebo N=102 n (%) Rash Includes rash, rash maculo-papular, rash erythematous, rash papular 48 (23) 2 (2) Headache 37 (18) 13 (13) Diarrhea 26 (13) 10 (10) Rhinitis 20 (10) 6 (6) Influenza 18 (9) 2 (2) Constipation 15 (7) 4 (4) Specific Adverse Reactions Liver Function Test Elevations In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 \u00d7 ULN was 1%, 2%, and 8% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1%, 1%, and 5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations (AST and/or ALT) was 11% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 4% in placebo-treated patients. In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum total bilirubin elevation >2 \u00d7 ULN was 4% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and <1% in placebo-treated patients. Maximum indirect and direct bilirubin elevations >1.5 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 11% and 3% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients, respectively. No TRIKAFTA-treated patients developed maximum direct bilirubin elevation >2 \u00d7 ULN. During Trial 3, in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN were 0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No TRIKAFTA-treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 \u00d7 ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations. During Trial 4 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0%, respectively. No TRIKAFTA-treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 \u00d7 ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN. One patient required treatment interruption during Trial 4 and later discontinued TRIKAFTA during the open label extension due to transaminase elevations. In Trial 5, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 \u00d7 ULN were 2.0%, 2.0%, and 6.3%, respectively, and led to treatment discontinuation in 0.5% and treatment interruptions in 1.5% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients. There were no transaminase elevations >3 \u00d7 ULN in placebo-treated patients. Rash In Trial 1, the overall incidence of rash was 10% in TRIKAFTA-treated and 5% in placebo-treated patients (see Table 4 ). The incidence of rash was higher in female TRIKAFTA-treated patients (16%) than in male TRIKAFTA-treated patients (5%). In Trial 5, the overall incidence of rash was 23% in TRIKAFTA-treated and 2% in placebo-treated patients (see Table 5 ). The incidence of rash was higher in female TRIKAFTA-treated patients (27%) than in male TRIKAFTA-treated patients (20%). A role of hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Increased Creatine Phosphokinase In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 \u00d7 ULN was 10% in TRIKAFTA-treated and 5% in placebo-treated patients. Among the TRIKAFTA-treated patients with creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 \u00d7 ULN, 14% (3/21) required treatment interruption and none discontinued treatment. In Trial 5, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 \u00d7 ULN was 5.4% (11/205) in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1% (1/102) in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase elevation >10 \u00d7 ULN was 2.4% (5/205) in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1% (1/102) in placebo-treated patients. There were no interruptions or discontinuations among the TRIKAFTA-treated patients with creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 \u00d7 ULN. Among the TRIKAFTA-treated patients with creatine phosphokinase elevation > 10 \u00d7 ULN, two patients, who had exercised within the preceding 72 hours, developed rhabdomyolysis without evidence of renal involvement resulting in treatment interruption in 1 patient. Increased Blood Pressure In Trial 1, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for TRIKAFTA-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic). The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg and 10 mmHg increase from baseline on at least two occasions was 4% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1% in placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients who had diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg and 5 mmHg increase from baseline on at least two occasions was 1% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 2% in placebo-treated patients. With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of TRIKAFTA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, sex, baseline percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ) and geographic regions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TRIKAFTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary : liver injury, fatal liver failure, liver transplantation Immune System Disorders : anaphylaxis, angioedema Nervous System Disorders : intracranial hypertension"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce TRIKAFTA dosage when used concomitantly. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit. ( 2.4 , 5.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs and Grapefruit on TRIKAFTA Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of TRIKAFTA with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended. Elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates of CYP3A (ivacaftor is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced TRIKAFTA efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Concomitant use of ivacaftor with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor exposures are expected to decrease during concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include: rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors The dosage of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Concomitant use with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased elexacaftor AUC by 2.8-fold and tezacaftor AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold. When used concomitantly with itraconazole and ketoconazole, ivacaftor AUC increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole telithromycin and clarithromycin The dosage of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Simulations indicated that concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase elexacaftor and tezacaftor AUC by approximately 1.9- to 2.3-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of fluconazole increased ivacaftor AUC by 2.9-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include: fluconazole erythromycin Grapefruit Concomitant use of TRIKAFTA with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor; therefore, food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with TRIKAFTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 7.2 Effect of TRIKAFTA on Other Drugs CYP2C9 Substrates Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during concomitant use of TRIKAFTA with warfarin is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased by TRIKAFTA include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Transporters Concomitant use of ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of TRIKAFTA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Elexacaftor and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. Concomitant use of TRIKAFTA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Bilirubin is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. 7.3 Drugs with No Clinically Significant Interactions with TRIKAFTA Ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of tezacaftor or ivacaftor and is not expected to affect the exposure of elexacaftor. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of TRIKAFTA with ciprofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Hormonal Contraceptives TRIKAFTA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. TRIKAFTA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives may play a role in the occurrence of rash and cannot be excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . For patients with CF taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, consider interrupting TRIKAFTA and hormonal contraceptives. Following the resolution of rash, consider resuming TRIKAFTA without the hormonal contraceptives. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials on the use of TRIKAFTA or its individual components, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Although there are no animal reproduction studies with the concomitant administration of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, separate reproductive and developmental studies were conducted with each active component of TRIKAFTA in pregnant rats and rabbits. In animal embryo fetal development (EFD) studies oral administration of elexacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 2 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and 4 times the MRHD in rabbits [based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite (for rat) and AUC of elexacaftor (for rabbit)]. Oral administration of tezacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 3 times the exposure at the MRHD in rats and 0.2 times the MRHD in rabbits (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 5 and 14 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively [based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites (for rat) and AUC of ivacaftor (for rabbit)]. No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of elexacaftor, tezacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from the period of organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 1 time, approximately 1 time and 3 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively [based on summed AUCs of parent and metabolite(s)] (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Elexacaftor In an EFD study, pregnant rats were administered oral doses of elexacaftor at 15, 25, and 40 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6-17. Elexacaftor did not cause adverse developmental outcomes at exposures up to 9 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for elexacaftor and its metabolite at maternal doses up to 40 mg/kg/day). Lower mean fetal body weights were observed at doses \u226525 mg/kg/day that produced maternal exposures \u22654 times the MRHD. Maternal toxicity was observed at 40 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered oral doses of elexacaftor at 50, 100, or 125 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-20. Elexacaftor was not teratogenic at exposures up to 4 times the MRHD (based on AUC of elexacaftor at maternal doses up to 125 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at 125 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD). In a pre- and postnatal development (PPND), pregnant rats were administered elexacaftor at oral doses of 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18. Elexacaftor did not cause adverse developmental outcomes in pups at maternal doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the MRHD based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Placental transfer of elexacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. Tezacaftor In an EFD study, pregnant rats were administered tezacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6-17. Tezacaftor did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Maternal toxicity in rats was observed at greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately greater than or equal to 1 time the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered tezacaftor at oral doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-20. Tezacaftor did not affect fetal developmental outcomes at exposures up to 0.2 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Lower fetal body weights were observed in rabbits at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures approximately 1 time the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg/day). In a PPND study, pregnant rats were administered tezacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18. Tezacaftor had no adverse developmental effects on pups at an exposure of approximately 1 time the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1-TEZ at a maternal dose of 25 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights and early developmental delays in pinna detachment, eye opening, and righting reflex occurred at a maternally toxic dose (based on maternal weight loss) that produced exposures approximately 2 times the exposure at the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Placental transfer of tezacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. Ivacaftor In an EFD study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-17. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (3 and 5 times the exposure at the MRHD) and was associated with a decrease in fetal body weights at a maternal dose of 200 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD). In an EFD study, pregnant rabbits were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-19. Ivacaftor did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 14 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity (i.e., death, decreased food consumption, decreased mean body weight and body weight gain, decreased clinical condition, abortions) was observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD). In a PPND study, pregnant rats were administered ivacaftor at oral doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20. Ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, or ivacaftor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TRIKAFTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TRIKAFTA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Elexacaftor: Lacteal excretion of elexacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (10 mg/kg) of 14 C-elexacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-elexacaftor in milk was approximately 0.4 times the value observed in plasma (based on AUC 0-72h ). Tezacaftor: Lacteal excretion of tezacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (30 mg/kg) of 14 C-tezacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-tezacaftor in milk was approximately 3 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-72h ). Ivacaftor: Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-ivacaftor in milk was approximately 1.5 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-24h ). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of CF have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data. Use of TRIKAFTA for this indication for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older was supported by evidence from two adequate and well-controlled studies (Trials 1 and 2) in CF patients aged 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. Use of TRIKAFTA for this indication in pediatric patients 2 to less than 12 years of age is based on the following: Trial 1, 56 pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years who had an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Trial 2, 16 pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Trial 3, 66 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Trial 4, 75 pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who had at least one F508del mutation or a mutation known to be responsive to TRIKAFTA [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Trial 5, 64 pediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years who had a least one qualifying non- F508del TRIKAFTA-responsive mutation and did not have an exclusionary mutation [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 2 to less than 12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients aged 2 to less than 12 years within the range of exposures observed in patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years was derived from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 66 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) administered either a total dose of elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 75 mg in the evening (for patients weighing less than 30 kg) or a total dose of elexacaftor 200 mg/tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 150 mg in the evening (for patients weighing 30 kg or more) (Trial 3). Safety of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years was derived from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 75 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age at baseline 4.1 years) administered either a total dose of elexacaftor 80 mg/tezacaftor 40 mg/ivacaftor 60 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 59.5 mg in the evening (for patients weighing 10 kg to less than 14 kg) or a total dose of elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 75 mg in the evening (for patients weighing 14 kg or more) (Trial 4). The safety profile of patients in these trials was similar to that observed in Trial 1 [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. The safety and effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF younger than 2 years of age have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 35 with ivacaftor dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day and higher (0.21 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites). This finding has not been observed in older animals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Studies were conducted with tezacaftor in juvenile rats starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 and ranging up to PNDs 35 to 49. Findings of convulsions and death were observed in juvenile rats that received a tezacaftor dose level of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 1.9 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). A no-effect dose level was identified at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 0.8 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period (PND 7, which would be approximately equivalent to a human neonate). Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are not relevant for the indicated pediatric population, 2 years of age and older, for whom levels of P-glycoprotein activity are equivalent to levels observed in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of TRIKAFTA did not include any patients aged 65 years and older. 8.6 Renal Impairment TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. Use with caution in patients with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): Should not be used. TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class B): Treatment is not recommended. Use of TRIKAFTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, TRIKAFTA should be used at a reduced dose. Liver function tests should be closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In a clinical study of 11 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, one subject developed total and direct bilirubin elevations >2 \u00d7 ULN, and a second subject developed direct bilirubin elevation >4.5 \u00d7 ULN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class A): No dose modification is recommended. Liver function tests should be closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.8 Patients with Severe Lung Dysfunction Trial 1 included a total of 18 patients receiving TRIKAFTA with ppFEV 1 <40 at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were comparable to those observed in the overall population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Elexacaftor and tezacaftor bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. Ivacaftor potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured both by CFTR mediated chloride transport in vitro and by sweat chloride in patients with CF. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid Cells Expressing Mutant CFTR Protein Effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on chloride transport for mutant CFTR proteins was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cell lines stably expressing individual mutant CFTR protein. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations, as identified in Table 6. The threshold that the treatment-induced increase in chloride transport must exceed for the mutant CFTR protein to be considered responsive is \u226510% of normal over baseline. This threshold was used because it is expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells Expressing Mutant CFTR Protein Homozygous and heterozygous N1303K -Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) cells showed greater chloride transport in the presence of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor than F508del/F508del -HBE cells treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (which has shown clinical benefit in people homozygous for F508del) . Patient Selection Select patients 2 years of age and older for treatment of CF with TRIKAFTA based on the presence of at least one F508del mutation or another responsive mutation in the CFTR gene (see Table 6 ) [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Table 6 lists CFTR mutations responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical response and/or in vitro data in FRT or HBE cells or based on extrapolation of efficacy.

In Trial 2 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline at Week 4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In Trial 3 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2). In Trial 4 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who had at least one F508del mutation or a mutation known to be responsive to TRIKAFTA), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6). In Trial 5 (patients aged 6 years and older with at least one qualifying non- F508del elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 compared to placebo was -28.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -32.1, -24.5). Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of elexacaftor and 3 times the maximum recommended dose of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients with CF. The pharmacokinetic parameters for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 7.

Following oral administration of TRIKAFTA to patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (elexacaftor 200 mg qd/tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h), the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC ss was 147 (36.8) mcg\u2219h/mL, 88.8 (21.8) mcg\u2219h/mL and 10.6 (3.35) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, similar to the AUC ss in adult patients. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal excretion of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is minimal. Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Based on population PK analyses, the clearance of elexacaftor and tezacaftor was similar in subjects with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). In a clinical study, following multiple doses of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had 25% higher AUC and 12% higher C max for elexacaftor, 73% higher AUC and 70% higher C max for M23-ELX, 36% higher AUC and 24% higher C max for combined elexacaftor and M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar C max for tezacaftor and 1.5-fold higher AUC and 10% higher C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher in C max for tezacaftor and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Ivacaftor In a study with ivacaftor alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold higher ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Male and Female Patients Based on population PK analysis, the exposures of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and/or Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A. However, clinical studies showed that the combination regimen of tezacaftor/ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP3A and ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not likely to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit the transporter P-gp, while ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit P-gp. Co-administration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold in a clinical study. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and M23-ELX may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of the transporters OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. The effects of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 9 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that elexacaftor and tezacaftor are substrates for the efflux transporter P-gp, but ivacaftor is not. Elexacaftor and ivacaftor are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3; tezacaftor is a substrate for OATP1B1, but not OATP1B3. Tezacaftor is a substrate for BCRP. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor are shown in Table 10 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Elexacaftor and tezacaftor bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. Ivacaftor potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured both by CFTR mediated chloride transport in vitro and by sweat chloride in patients with CF. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid Cells Expressing Mutant CFTR Protein Effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on chloride transport for mutant CFTR proteins was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cell lines stably expressing individual mutant CFTR protein. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations, as identified in Table 6. The threshold that the treatment-induced increase in chloride transport must exceed for the mutant CFTR protein to be considered responsive is \u226510% of normal over baseline. This threshold was used because it is expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells Expressing Mutant CFTR Protein Homozygous and heterozygous N1303K -Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) cells showed greater chloride transport in the presence of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor than F508del/F508del -HBE cells treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (which has shown clinical benefit in people homozygous for F508del) . Patient Selection Select patients 2 years of age and older for treatment of CF with TRIKAFTA based on the presence of at least one F508del mutation or another responsive mutation in the CFTR gene (see Table 6 ) [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Table 6 lists CFTR mutations responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical response and/or in vitro data in FRT or HBE cells or based on extrapolation of efficacy.

Following oral administration of TRIKAFTA to patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (elexacaftor 200 mg qd/tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h), the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC ss was 147 (36.8) mcg\u2219h/mL, 88.8 (21.8) mcg\u2219h/mL and 10.6 (3.35) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, similar to the AUC ss in adult patients. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal excretion of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is minimal. Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Based on population PK analyses, the clearance of elexacaftor and tezacaftor was similar in subjects with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). In a clinical study, following multiple doses of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had 25% higher AUC and 12% higher C max for elexacaftor, 73% higher AUC and 70% higher C max for M23-ELX, 36% higher AUC and 24% higher C max for combined elexacaftor and M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar C max for tezacaftor and 1.5-fold higher AUC and 10% higher C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher in C max for tezacaftor and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Ivacaftor In a study with ivacaftor alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold higher ivacaftor AUC 0-\u221e compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Male and Female Patients Based on population PK analysis, the exposures of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and/or Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A. However, clinical studies showed that the combination regimen of tezacaftor/ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP3A and ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not likely to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit the transporter P-gp, while ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit P-gp. Co-administration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold in a clinical study. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and M23-ELX may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of the transporters OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. The effects of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 9 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that elexacaftor and tezacaftor are substrates for the efflux transporter P-gp, but ivacaftor is not. Elexacaftor and ivacaftor are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3; tezacaftor is a substrate for OATP1B1, but not OATP1B3. Tezacaftor is a substrate for BCRP. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor are shown in Table 10 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility were conducted with the combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor; however, separate studies of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are described below. Elexacaftor A 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at 50 mg/kg/day dose, the highest dose tested. A two-year study was conducted in rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of elexacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at elexacaftor oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 and 5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite in male and female rats, respectively). Elexacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus assay in TK6 cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Elexacaftor did not cause reproductive system toxicity in male rats at 55 mg/kg/day and female rats at 25 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 6 times and 4 times the MRHD, respectively (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Elexacaftor did not cause embryonic toxicity at 35 mg/kg/day which was the highest dose tested, equivalent to approximately 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Lower male and female fertility, male copulation and female conception indices were observed in males at 75 mg/kg/day and females at 35 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 6 times and 7 times, respectively, the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Tezacaftor A two-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats and a 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of tezacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from tezacaftor was observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 50 and 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolites in males and females, respectively). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male and female Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice at tezacaftor doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. Tezacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. There were no effects on male or female fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral tezacaftor doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUC of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Ivacaftor Two-year studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of ivacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from ivacaftor was observed in mice or rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equivalent to 2 and 7 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 5 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg/kg/day. Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea, implantations and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day were attributed to severe toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis with at Least One F508del Mutation The efficacy of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) with at least one F508del mutation was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Trial 1 (NCT03525444) was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who had an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor. An interim analysis was planned when at least 140 patients completed Week 4 and at least 100 patients completed Week 12. Trial 2 (NCT03525548) was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. Patients received tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h during a 4-week, open-label run-in period and were then randomized and dosed to receive TRIKAFTA or tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h during a 4-week, double-blind treatment period. Patients in Trials 1 and 2 had a confirmed diagnosis of CF and at least one F508del mutation. Patients discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, but continued on their other standard-of-care CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline). Patients had a ppFEV 1 at screening between 40-90%. Patients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT \u22653 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin \u22652 \u00d7 ULN), were excluded from the trials. Patients in Trials 1 and 2 were eligible to roll over into an open-label extension study. Trial 1 Trial 1 evaluated 403 patients (200 TRIKAFTA, 203 placebo) with CF aged 12 years and older (mean age 26.2 years). The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%). The primary endpoint assessed at the time of interim analysis was mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The final analysis tested all key secondary endpoints in the 403 patients who completed the 24-week study participation, including absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24; absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Week 4 and through Week 24; number of pulmonary exacerbations through Week 24; absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 24, and absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score (a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF, such as cough, sputum production and difficulty breathing) from baseline at Week 4 and through Week 24. Of the 403 patients included in the interim analysis, the treatment difference between TRIKAFTA and placebo for the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 4 was 13.8 percentage points (95% CI: 12.1, 15.4; P <0.0001). The treatment difference between TRIKAFTA and placebo for mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 was 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; P <0.0001). Mean improvement in ppFEV 1 was observed at the first assessment on Day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period (see Figure 1 ). Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, baseline ppFEV 1 , sex and geographic region. See Table 11 for a summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in Trial 1.

The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline, following the 4-week, open-label run-in period with tezacaftor/ivacaftor was 60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%). The primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 of the double-blind treatment period. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were absolute change in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4. Treatment with TRIKAFTA compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV 1 of 10.0 percentage points (95% CI: 7.4, 12.6; P <0.0001). Mean improvement in ppFEV 1 was observed at the first assessment on Day 15. Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV 1 and geographic region. See Table 12 for a summary of primary and key secondary outcomes.

Trial 5 (NCT05274269) was a 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 307 patients aged 6 years and older with CF (mean age 33.5 years). The mean baseline ppFEV1 was 67.7% (range: 34.0%, 108.7%). The trial included patients who had at least one qualifying non- F508del TRIKAFTA-responsive mutation and did not have an exclusionary mutation. Patients were randomized to TRIKAFTA or placebo. The dosage of TRIKAFTA was administered according to age and weight as follows: Patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, weighing less than 30 kg: total morning dose of elexacaftor 100 mg/ tezacaftor 50 mg/ ivacaftor 75 mg and evening dose of ivacaftor 75 mg Patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg: total morning dose of elexacaftor 200 mg/ tezacaftor 100 mg/ ivacaftor 150 mg and evening dose of ivacaftor 150 mg Patients aged 12 years and older: total morning dose of elexacaftor 200 mg/ tezacaftor 100 mg/ ivacaftor 150 mg and evening dose of ivacaftor 150 mg Patients discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies but continued on their other standard-of-care CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline). Patients had a ppFEV 1 between 40-100% at screening. The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline was 68% (range: 34%, 109%). Patients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT \u22653 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin \u22652 \u00d7 ULN), were excluded from the trials. Patients in Trial 5 were eligible to roll over into an open-label extension study. In Trial 5, the primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints were absolute change in sweat chloride through week 24, absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through week 24, absolute change in growth parameters (BMI, weight) at week 24, and number of pulmonary exacerbation events through week 24.
