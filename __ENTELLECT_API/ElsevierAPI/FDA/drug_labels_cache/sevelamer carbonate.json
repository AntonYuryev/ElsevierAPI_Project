      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablet is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are ammonium hydroxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lecithin, mannitol, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, shellac, talc, xanthan gum and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains iron oxide black ink."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31% the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and two clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. Thesevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, crossover study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and onerandomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 grams/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and activecontrol for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of activecontrol could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 grams (range of 0 to 12.6 grams). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an activecontrol (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7.

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 grams (range of 0.8 to 13 grams). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus>5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 grams (range 0.8 to 14.3 grams). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three-times-per-day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 grams/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 grams/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 grams/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-518-2989 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate tablets. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets. ( 7 )",
      "Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate tablets are not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate tablets. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature.

Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose)."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate tablets are known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate tablets contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains black iron oxide, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Figure 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis ( Figure 2 ). [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 4 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL ( Table 6 ). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active- Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3 . The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus ( Table 7 ). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active- Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4 , a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Graph 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use. Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3 to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate.

Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl behenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15 to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study.

Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). image description 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). image description 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once a Day Versus Three Times a Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate tablets discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate tablets should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/ml) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/ml to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/ml (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Precision Dose, Inc. at 1-800-397-9228 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to Sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose)."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

There are no reports of overdosage with sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride in patients. Since sevelamer is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer carbonate tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are diacetylated monoglycerides, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide and zinc stearate. Imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, propylene glycol and shellac. Figure 1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31 %; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12 by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31 ); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N= 144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u2265 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dl compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dl, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Rgure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup Note: LS Mean difference ofSevelamer Carbonate - Placebo, based on AN COVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dl (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dl. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N= 101 ). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dl) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dl from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three\u2013Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dl for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dl for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AiPing Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-844-374-0016 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate tablets are not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate tablets. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019- diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b =9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets : Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection).The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u2265 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure-2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure-3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7).

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure-4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p <0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Ltd., at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae) . Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, hydroxy propyl cellulose, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, and diacetylated monoglycerides.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m \u00b2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, zinc stearate, hypromellose, diacetylated monoglycerides. Imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, propylene glycol and shellac."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer \u2022 For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose)."

In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablet is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are ammonium hydroxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lecithin, mannitol, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, shellac, talc, xanthan gum and zinc stearate.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31% the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 grams/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and activecontrol for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of activecontrol could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 grams (range of 0 to 12.6 grams). figure3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an activecontrol (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7.

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 grams (range of 0.8 to 13 grams). figure4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus>5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 grams (range 0.8 to 14.3 grams). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three-times-per-day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 grams/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 grams/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 grams/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6\u201310 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1-800-847-0069 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8\u201352 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%\u201316%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3\u20134 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Chemical Structure Sevelamer carbonate tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are hypromellose, diacetylated monoglycerides, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium chloride, and zinc stearate. Sevelamer carbonate powder: Each packet contains 0.8 or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are natural and artificial citrus flavor, propylene glycol alginate, sodium chloride, sucralose, and ferric oxide (yellow)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate is a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%\u201331%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4\u20132.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-518-2989 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate tablets. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets. ( 7 )",
      "Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate tablets are known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate tablets contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains black iron oxide, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Figure 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis ( Figure 2 ). [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 4 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL ( Table 6 ). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active- Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3 . The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus ( Table 7 ). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active- Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4 , a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Graph 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer \u2022 For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablet is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1.

The inactive ingredients are ammonium hydroxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lecithin, mannitol, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, shellac, talc, xanthan gum and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains iron oxide black ink. figure1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31% the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and two clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. Thesevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, crossover study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and onerandomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 grams/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and activecontrol for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of activecontrol could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride(N=81) Active Control(N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 grams (range of 0 to 12.6 grams). figure3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an activecontrol (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7.

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 grams (range of 0.8 to 13 grams). figure4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus>5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 grams (range 0.8 to 14.3 grams). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three-times-per-day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 grams/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 grams/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 grams/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844- 221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate tablets. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5.

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate tablets are not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate tablets. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate tablets are known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2- hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate tablets contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains black iron oxide, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Chemical Structure 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison -2.1 (95% Confidence Interval) (-2.5, -1.5) (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Chemical Structure 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Chemical Structure 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer \u2022 For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose)."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, zinc stearate, hypromellose, diacetylated monoglycerides. Imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, propylene glycol and shellac. sevelamer-car-structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. figure-2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). figure-3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). figure-4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Powder: Each packet of sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains 0.8 g or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are mannitol, ferric oxide yellow, povidone k-30, xanthan gum, sodium chloride, sucralose, orange flavor permaseal phs-133147, vanilla flavor 78506-32 and lemon juice flavor phs-221397. str"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. fig-2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). fig-1 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). fig-4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, zinc stearate, hypromellose, diacetylated monoglycerides. Imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, propylene glycol and shellac. sevelamer-car-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. figure-2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). figure-3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). figure-4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use. Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p <0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., at 1-855-295-7455 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3 to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate.

However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid-and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use Sevelamer carbonate tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) tablets. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae) . Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of crosslinking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, hydroxy propyl cellulose, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and diacetylated monoglycerides.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) tablets. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of patients (Y-axis) attaining a phosphorus reduction from baseline (mg/dL) at least as great as the value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 3 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once a Day Versus Three Times a Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dl after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Powder: Each packet of sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains 0.8 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are mannitol, ferric oxide yellow, povidone k-30, xanthan gum, sodium chloride, sucralose, orange flavor permaseal phs-133147, vanilla flavor 78506-32 and lemon juice flavor phs-221397. str"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. fig-2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). fig-1 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). fig-4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 4: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer \u2022 For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7) \u2022 Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) \u2022 Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)"

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl dibehenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2. Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2. Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 5. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

(5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate tablets discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate tablets should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact Strides Pharma Inc. at 1-877-244-9825 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Sevelamer Carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, Sevelamer Carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, Sevelamer Carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer Carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer Carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N, N'-diallyl-1,3- diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer Carbonate is white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 0.8 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, opadry clear, opacode black, povidone and sodium chloride. Opadry clear contains hypromellose 2910 (15 mPas), hypromellose 2910 (5 mPas), di-acetylated monoglycerides. Opacode black contains shellac, ferrosoferric oxide. description"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCL (N=94) Active-Control (N =98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. Figure-2 figure 2 Image"

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablet is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31% the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and two clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. Thesevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, crossover study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and onerandomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 grams/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and activecontrol for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of activecontrol could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride(N=81) Active Control(N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 grams (range of 0 to 12.6 grams). figure3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an activecontrol (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7.

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 grams (range of 0.8 to 13 grams). figure4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus>5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 grams (range 0.8 to 14.3 grams). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three-times-per-day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 grams/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 grams/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 grams/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p < 0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1- 877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children < 13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Sevelamer carbonate is a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2 Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6).

The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3 Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7 Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer hydrochloride (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4 Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p < 0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. image Image Image"

(5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use. Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7) Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) tablets and Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) for oral suspension. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, these drug products are not labeled with that pediatric information."

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to Sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In CKD patients on dialysis, the maximum dose studied was 14 grams of sevelamer carbonate and 13 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride. There are no reports of overdosage with sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride in patients. Since sevelamer is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) tablets and Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) for oral suspension. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, these drug products are not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u00a41.2 m2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2) . 1 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of patients (Y-axis) attaining a phosphorus reduction from baseline (mg/dL) at least as great as the value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). F-2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). F-3 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once a Day Versus Three Times a Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dl after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate tablets discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate tablets should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to Sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer carbonate tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablet contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). F-2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). F-3 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate tablets clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate tablets discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate tablets should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate tablets. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active- control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate tablet is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate tablets. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate tablets in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate tablets was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate tablet is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablet has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablet is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3\u00ad-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Tablets: Each film-coated sevelamer carbonate tablet contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are diacetylated monoglycerides, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 4000, titanium dioxide and zinc stearate. Imprinting ink contains ferrosoferric oxide and shellac. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open- label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross- Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three- times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)"

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl dibehenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup Figure 2. Change in serum phosphorus (mg/dL) from baseline to Week 2 by subgroup 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 * (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3. Percentage of patients (Y-axis) attaining a phosphorus reduction from baseline (mg/dL) at least as great as the value of the X-axis. 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)"

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate.

In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl dibehenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 * (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl dibehenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2. Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2. Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting dose of sevelamer carbonate is 0.8 or 1.6 grams administered orally three times per day with meals based on serum phosphorus levels for adult patients and based on body surface area (BSA) category for pediatric patients. (2.1) Titrate by 0.8 g per meal in two week intervals for adult patients as needed to obtain serum phosphorus target. (2.1) Titrate based on BSA category for pediatric patients in two week intervals for 6 weeks and then every 4 weeks as needed to obtain serum phosphorus target. (2.1) 2.1 General Dosing Information Starting Dose for Adult Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder. The recommended starting dose of sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is 0.8 to 1.6 g taken orally with meals based on serum phosphorus level. Table 1 provides recommended starting doses of sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension for adult patients not taking a phosphate binder. Table 1: Starting Dose for Adult Dialysis Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder Serum Phosphorus Sevelamer Carbonate for oral suspension > 5.5 and < 7.5 mg/dL 0.8 g three times daily with meals \u2265 7.5 mg/dL 1.6 g three times daily with meals Dose Titration for Adult Patients Taking Sevelamer Carbonate for oral suspension. Titrate the sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension dose by 0.8 g three times per day with meals at two-week intervals as necessary to achieve target serum phosphorus levels. Based on clinical studies, the average prescribed adult daily dose of sevelamer carbonate is approximately 7.2 g per day. The highest daily adult dose of sevelamer carbonate studied was 14 grams in CKD patients on dialysis. Starting Dose for Pediatric Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder. The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is 0.8 g to 1.6 g taken three times per day with meals based on the patient's body surface area (BSA) category; see Table 2.

(5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact Strides Pharma Inc. at 1-877-244-9825 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Sevelamer Carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, Sevelamer Carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, Sevelamer Carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer Carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer Carbonate is white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension: Each packet of Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains 0.8 g or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross- over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7).

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once- Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. Figure 2 figure 2 Image"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammmatory disorder may resolve upon sevelamer carbonatesevelamer carbonate disconuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p < 0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-BION or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n = 99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n = 101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children < 13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In CKD patients on dialysis, the maximum dose studied was 14 grams of sevelamer carbonate and 13 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride. There are no reports of overdosage with sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride in patients. Since sevelamer is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3\u00addiamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water and other solvents. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Each packet of sevelamer carbonate powder contains 0.8 g or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are lemon flavor, propylene glycol alginate, silicon dioxide, sodium chloride, and sucralose. Figure 1: Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Standard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats. Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N = 24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N = 220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N = 256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N = 31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N = 144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N = 73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n = 50) or placebo (n = 51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u2265 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p = 0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to < 13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. image description 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross\u00ad-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N = 81) Active Control (N = 83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p < 0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N = 99) or an active control (N = 101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N = 94) Active Control (N = 98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N = 97) or active control (N = 46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p < 0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N = 144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N = 73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three-times-per-day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are acetylated monoglycerides, ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, glyceryl dibehenate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, mannitol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze and talc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2).

Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Navinta LLC at 1-609-883-1135 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose)."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets : Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, copovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium stearyl fumarate and purified water. The film coating contains hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, macrogol/polyethylene glycol and titanium dioxide. Image"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. Image Image Image"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov / medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. (7)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children < 13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3- diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network groups Sevelamer Carbonate Powder: Each packet of sevelamer carbonate powder contains 0.8 g or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single-dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Co-administered single-dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate-binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u2265 1.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p = 0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to < 13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.0* -2.1* (95% Confidence Interval) (-2.5, -1.5) (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). qt 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). gh 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p < 0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Monitor for Reduced Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5.

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid-and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 grams). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ].

In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Powder: Each packet of sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains 0.8 grams or 2.4 grams of sevelamer carbonate. The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, iron oxide yellow, lemon spray dry flavor, mannitol, propylene glycol, PHA vanilla flavor, PHA orange flavor, and sucralose."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31% the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 grams/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 grams/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) *p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of patients (Y-axis) attaining a phosphorus reduction from baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 grams (range of 0 to 12.6 grams). 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7.

Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 grams (range of 0.8 to 13 grams). 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 grams (range 0.8 to 14.3 grams). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dl after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 grams/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 grams/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 grams/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3% to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3 to 4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Sevelamer Carbonate Powder: Each pouch of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder contains 0.8 g or 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are ferric oxide (yellow), orange flavor, sucralose and xanthan gum. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus)."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15% to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2. Change in serum phosphorus (mg/dL) from baseline to Week 2 by subgroup 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint * p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0* (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1* (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 7.5 -2.1 7.3 -1.8 Ca x Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline Change from Baseline at Endpoint 70.5 -19.4 68.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times- per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use. Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-518-2989 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate tablets. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3 to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 3. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer \u2022 For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

( 7 ) \u2022 Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets. ( 7 )",
      "Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate tablets are known chemically as poly (allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. : Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate Sevelamer carbonate tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate tablets contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, and zinc stearate. The tablet imprint contains black iron oxide, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Sevelamer Carbonate Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15 to 31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate for oral suspension and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s RENVELA \u00ae (sevelamer carbonate) tablets and RENVELA \u00ae (sevelamer carbonate) for oral suspension. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, these drug products are not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL ( Table 6 ). Table 4: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active- Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Error!

Figure 2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus ( Table 7 ).

Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Graph 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once a Day versus Three Times a Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dl after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use. Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p <0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Ltd., at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients, with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in > 5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3 to 16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5. Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate.

Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid-and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae) . Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of crosslinking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, hydroxy propyl cellulose, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and diacetylated monoglycerides.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin. Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26% respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus)."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed.

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79), one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31) and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric use information is approved for Genzyme Corporation\u2019s Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) tablets. However, due to Genzyme Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active-control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3. Percentage of patients (Y-axis) attaining a phosphorus reduction from baseline (mg/dL) at least as great as the value of the X-axis. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 2 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101). At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, sevelamer and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 3 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride Versus Active-Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control. 14.7 Once a Day Versus Three Times a Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of > 5.5 mg/dl after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once daily dose than three times per day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three times per day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6\u201310 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AiPing Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-844-374-0016 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar.In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8\u201352 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%\u201316%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate tablets and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate tablets Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. ( 7 )"

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3\u20134 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate tablets are not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to Sevelamer carbonate tablets. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Sevelamer carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine- co -N,N\u2032-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%\u201331%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4\u20132.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Five of the active-controlled studies are described here (two sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m 2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison -2.1 (95% Confidence Interval) (-2.5, -1.5) (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4: Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once-daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer carbonate clinical studies. Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer carbonate discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer carbonate should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer carbonate tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of sevelamer carbonate. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3%-16%). In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction, and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 5: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. ( 7 ) Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from sevelamer carbonate. ( 7 )"

Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. Data Animal data In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high-dose groups (human equivalent doses approximately equal to 3-4 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to sevelamer carbonate. Clinical Considerations Sevelamer carbonate may decrease serum levels of fat soluble vitamins and folic acid in pregnant women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider supplementation. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in lowering serum phosphorus levels was studied in patients 6 years of age and older with CKD. In this study, sevelamer carbonate was apparently less effective in children with a low baseline serum phosphorus, which described children <13 years of age and children not on dialysis. Given its mechanism of action, sevelamer carbonate is expected to be effective in lowering serum phosphorus levels in pediatric patients with CKD. Most adverse events that were reported as related, or possibly related, to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the trial. Sevelamer carbonate tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sevelamer carbonate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range."

      "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in sevelamer carbonate tablets is sevelamer carbonate, a polymeric amine that binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel \u00ae ). Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin, with the same polymeric structure as sevelamer hydrochloride, in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety involved in phosphate-binding, is the same. Sevelamer carbonate is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N\u2019-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. Sevelamer carbonate is hygroscopic, but insoluble in water. The structure is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Carbonate a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9 c = number of cross-linking groups c = 1 m = large number to indicate extended polymer network Sevelamer Carbonate Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of sevelamer carbonate contains 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate on an anhydrous basis. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, hydroxy propyl cellulose, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, and diacetylated monoglycerides.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sevelamer carbonate tablets contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate-binding cross-linked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15%-31%; the clinical significance of this finding, which was observed after 2 weeks, is unclear. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and albumin did not change. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A mass balance study using 14 C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease. Drug Interactions In vivo Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4 to 2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil, and warfarin. Coadministered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0\u201312h by 36% and 26%, respectively. Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin when coadministered. During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients coadministered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs."

Rats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g). Mice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose). There was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice. In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations. Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating. The highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of sevelamer to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was predominantly determined from the effects of the hydrochloride salt to bind phosphate. Six clinical trials used sevelamer hydrochloride and three clinical trials used sevelamer carbonate. The sevelamer hydrochloride studies include one double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-week study (sevelamer N=24); two open-label, uncontrolled, 8-week studies (sevelamer N=220); and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (sevelamer N=256). The sevelamer carbonate studies include one double-blind, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 8-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate tablets (N=79); one open-label, active-controlled, cross-over study with two 4-week treatment periods using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=31); and one randomized, parallel, open-label study using sevelamer carbonate powder (N=144) dosed once daily or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (N=73) dosed three times daily for 24 weeks. Six of the active-controlled studies are described here (three sevelamer carbonate and three sevelamer hydrochloride studies). 14.1 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate 800 mg Tablets and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) 800 mg Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 79 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day divided among meals for both treatments. Thirty-nine of those completing the cross-over portion of the study were entered into a two-week washout period during which patients were instructed not to take any phosphate binders; this confirmed the activity of sevelamer in this study. 14.2 Cross-Over Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Sevelamer Hydrochloride (Renagel) Tablets Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a four-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and 31 patients received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets for four weeks each with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram-per-gram basis. The phosphorus levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6.0 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 g/day divided among meals for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets. 14.3 Clinical Study of Sevelamer Carbonate Powder and Tablets in Pediatric Patients A clinical study with sevelamer carbonate was conducted in 101 patients 6 to 18 years of age with chronic kidney disease. This study included a washout period for patients on a phosphate binder, a 2-week, double-blind, fixed-dose period (FDP) in which patients were randomized to sevelamer carbonate (n=50) or placebo (n=51), and a 26-week, open-label, sevelamer carbonate dose titration period (DTP). Most patients were 13 to 18 years of age (73%) and had a BSA \u22651.2 m \u00b2 (84%). Approximately 78% of patients were CKD patients on dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 (primary endpoint) by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.27) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.001). A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP. Approximately 30% of subjects reached their target serum phosphorus. The median prescribed daily dose was approximately 7.0 g per day during the titration period. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent by BSA subgroup. In contrast, a treatment effect was not observed in subjects with a baseline serum phosphorus below 7 mg/dL, many of whom were the subjects 6 to <13 years of age or the subjects not on dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2: Change in Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 2 by Subgroup [a]: LS Mean difference of Sevelamer Carbonate \u2013 Placebo, based on ANCOVA within subgroup and with treatment as fixed effect and screening BSA and baseline serum phosphorus as covariates. Figure 2 14.4 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized in a cross-over design to receive in random order sevelamer hydrochloride and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride could be titrated up to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphorus control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 6). Table 6: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) at Baseline and Endpoint Sevelamer Hydrochloride (N=81) Active Control (N=83) Baseline at End of Washout 8.4 8.0 Endpoint 6.4 5.9 Change from Baseline at Endpoint (95% Confidence Interval) -2.0 p<0.0001, within treatment group comparison (-2.5, -1.5) -2.1 (-2.6, -1.7) The distribution of responses is shown in Figure 3. The distributions are similar for sevelamer hydrochloride and active control. The median response is a reduction of about 2 mg/dL in both groups. About 50% of subjects have reductions between 1 and 3 mg/dL. Figure 3: Percentage of Patients (Y-axis) Attaining a Phosphorus Reduction from Baseline (mg/dL) at Least as Great as the Value of the X-axis Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g). Figure 3 14.5 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Hemodialysis Patients Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate-binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active control (N=101). At week 52, using last observation carried forward, sevelamer and active control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 7). Table 7: Mean Serum Phosphorus (mg/dL) and Ion Product at Baseline and Change from Baseline to End of Treatment Sevelamer HCl (N=94) Active-Control (N=98) Phosphorus Baseline 7.5 7.3 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -2.1 -1.8 Ca \u00d7 Phosphorus Ion Product Baseline 70.5 68.4 Change from Baseline at Endpoint -19.4 -14.2 Sixty-one percent of sevelamer hydrochloride patients and 73% of the control patients completed the full 52 weeks of treatment. Figure 4, a plot of the phosphorus change from baseline for the completers, illustrates the durability of response for patients who are able to remain on treatment. Figure 4. Mean Phosphorus Change from Baseline for Patients who Completed 52 Weeks of Treatment Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g). Figure 4 14.6 Sevelamer Hydrochloride versus Active Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride (N=97) or active control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks. Average daily sevelamer hydrochloride dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p<0.001) for sevelamer hydrochloride (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control. 14.7 Once-Daily versus Three-Times-Per-Day Dosing Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis with a serum phosphate level of >5.5 mg/dL after washout from baseline therapies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (N=144) or sevelamer hydrochloride as a tablet with the dose divided three times per day (N=73) for 24 weeks. The initial dose for the two groups was 4.8 g/day. At the end of the study, the total daily dose was 6.2 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily and 6.7 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day. A greater percentage of subjects on the once-daily dose than three-times-per-day regimen discontinued therapy prematurely, 35% versus 15%. The reasons for discontinuation were largely driven by adverse events and withdrawal of consent in the once-daily dosing regimen. Serum phosphate levels and calcium-phosphate product were better controlled on the three-times-per-day regimen than on the once daily regimen. Mean serum phosphorus decreased 2.0 mg/dL for sevelamer carbonate powder once-daily and 2.9 mg/dL for sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day."
