      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage in Cysteamine-Na\u00efve Patients See full prescribing information for weight-based dosing tables for the starting and maintenance dosage. ( 2.2 ) For initial intolerance, temporarily discontinue and then re-start PROCYSBI at a lower dosage and gradually increase to the maintenance dosage. ( 2.2 ) Switching from Immediate-release Cysteamine to PROCYSBI Start with a total daily dose of PROCYSBI equal to the previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. ( 2.3 ) Dose Titration Adjust dose to achieve a therapeutic target white blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration. ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) If a dose adjustment is required, increase the dosage by 10%. The maximum dosage is 1.95 grams/m 2 per day. ( 2.4 ) If adverse reactions occur, decrease the dosage. Some patients may be unable to achieve their therapeutic target. ( 2.4 ) Preparation and Administration ( 2.6 ) Capsules : Swallow whole; do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. Take the capsules with fruit juice (except grapefruit juice) or water. Oral Granules: Do not crush or chew the granules. Sprinkle and mix the granules in applesauce, berry jelly or fruit juice (except grapefruit juice). For patients who cannot swallow the capsules or with gastrostomy tubes, see the full prescribing information on how to prepare and administer the capsules and oral granules. Administer PROCYSBI at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate. Do not eat for at least 2 hours before and for at least 30 minutes after taking PROCYSBI. If unable to take PROCYSBI without eating, take with food but limit the amount of food to approximately 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) 1 hour before through 1 hour after administration. Avoid high fat food close to dosing. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking PROCYSBI. 2.1 Important Dosing Instructions Initiate cysteamine treatment immediately after diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine-na\u00efve Patients: Start PROCYSBI at a fraction of the maintenance dosage. Patients 1 year to less than 6 years : Gradually increase the dosage, allowing a minimum of 2 weeks between adjustments [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients 6 years of age and older : Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved. Patients switching from immediate-release cysteamine: Start the total daily dosage of PROCYSBI at a dosage equal to the previous total daily dosage of immediate-release cysteamine [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . If adverse reactions occur, decrease the PROCYSBI dosage. After the maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI is achieved: The dosage may need to be further increased to achieve a therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration. The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m 2 of body surface area per day [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ] . Round dose calculations to the nearest incremental dosage that can be administered using the available strengths of PROCYSBI delayed-release capsules or packets of oral granules. Only use whole capsules or entire contents of the packets. 2.2 Starting and Maintenance Dosing in Cysteamine-Na\u00efve Patients Start treatment with a dosage equal to \u2159 to \u00bc of the maintenance dosage. The maintenance dosage after initial dose escalation is 1.3 g/m 2 of body surface area per day divided into two doses given every 12 hours. Table 1 shows the recommended starting and maintenance dosages of PROCYSBI, converted from body-surface area to body weight. Patients 1 year to less than 6 years : Increase the dosage in 10% increments to the maintenance dosage, while monitoring WBC cystine concentrations. Allow a minimum of 2 weeks between dosage adjustments [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ] . If a patient achieves the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration at a dosage below the recommended weight-based maintenance dosage, then stop dosage escalation and use the dosage as the patient's maintenance dosage. Patients 6 years of age and older : Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved. If a patient experiences initial intolerance, temporarily discontinue PROCYSBI and then re-start at a lower dosage and gradually increase dosage. Table 1: Starting and Maintenance Dosage of PROCYSBI by Body Weight in Cysteamine-Na\u00efve Patients 1 Year of Age and Older (Dosage Rounded Using Available Strengths of Capsules or Packets of Oral Granules) Weight in kilograms Starting PROCYSBI Dosage in mg every 12 hours, as a Fraction of the Maintenance Dosage Maintenance PROCYSBI Dosage in mg every 12 hours Higher dosages may be required to achieve target therapeutic WBC cystine concentration [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . \u2159 of dosage \u00bc of dosage 5 or less 25 50 200 6 to 10 50 75 300 11 to 15 75 100 400 16 to 20 100 125 500 21 to 25 100 150 600 26 to 30 125 175 700 31 to 40 125 200 800 41 to 50 150 225 900 51 kg and greater 175 250 1000 2.3 Switching Patients from Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate When switching patients from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI, the starting total daily dose of PROCYSBI is equal to the previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Divide the total daily dose by two and administer every 12 hours. For patients who may experience temporary intolerance upon starting PROCYSBI, decrease the dosage and then gradually increase to the maintenance dosage. Measure the WBC cystine concentration two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Adjust the PROCYSBI dosage as needed to achieve the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m 2 per day. 2.4 Dosage Titration to Therapeutic Target WBC Cystine Concentration Measure WBC cystine concentration and titrate the PROCYSBI dosage as needed to achieve the therapeutic target WBC cysteine concentration [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . If the measured WBC cystine concentration is above the target level for cystine depletion, consider the following before dose adjustment: adherence to medication and dosing interval, the timing between the last dose and the blood draw for the laboratory measurement, and the timing of PROCYSBI administration in relation to food or other administration instructions. If a dose adjustment is required, increase the dosage by 10%, rounded to nearest dosage that can be administered using the available strengths of capsules or packets of oral granules. For patients 1 year to less than 6 years of age, allow a minimum of two weeks between dose increments. The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m 2 per day. If adverse reactions occur, decrease the PROCYSBI dosage. Some patients may be unable to achieve their therapeutic target due to poor tolerability of PROCYSBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.5 Laboratory Monitoring WBC cystine concentration may be measured using the mixed leukocyte assay or by using assays for specific WBC subsets (e.g., granulocyte method). The methods used for measuring cystine and total protein content may also vary among individual laboratories [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Normal WBC cystine ranges and therapeutic target levels for cystine depletion depend upon the assay method used by the individual laboratory. WBC cystine values obtained from using different assay methods may not be comparable. Refer to the assay-specific therapeutic target for cystine depletion. When using the mixed leukocyte assay, the recommended target WBC cystine concentration is less than 1 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein . The recommended frequency of monitoring WBC cystine concentration is as follows: Cysteamine-na\u00efve patients 1 year to less than 6 years : Obtain measurement two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI treatment and continue monitoring during dosage titration period until the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration is achieved. Once the therapeutic target is achieved, continue monitoring monthly for 3 months, then quarterly for 1 year, and then twice-yearly, at a minimum. Cysteamine-na\u00efve patients greater than 6 years : Obtain measurement after reaching the maintenance PROCYSBI dosage, then monthly for 3 months, quarterly for 1 year, and then twice-yearly, at a minimum. Patients switching from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI : Obtain measurement two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI treatment and continue monitoring if further dosage titration is required to achieve therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration. Once the therapeutic target is achieved, continue monitoring quarterly for 6 months, then twice yearly, at a minimum. Obtain blood samples for WBC cystine concentration measurement 12 hours after the patient's last PROCYSBI dose, prior to administration of the next dose (i.e., trough concentration). In addition, it is important to accurately record the time of the last dose, the actual dose, and the time the blood sample was taken. 2.6 Preparation and Administration PROCYSBI delayed-release capsules: Swallow capsules whole. Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. Take capsules with fruit juice (except grapefruit juice) or water. For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, the capsules can be opened and the capsule contents sprinkled on and mixed in applesauce, berry jelly or fruit juice (except grapefruit juice) and administered orally, as described below. For patients with a gastrostomy tube, the capsules can be opened and the capsule contents mixed in applesauce and administered via the gastrostomy tube, as described below. PROCYSBI delayed-release oral granules: Do not crush or chew oral granules. Sprinkle and mix the intact granules in applesauce, berry jelly or fruit juice (except grapefruit juice) and administered orally, as described below. For patients with a gastrostomy tube, the oral granules can be mixed in applesauce and administered via a gastrostomy tube, as described below. Administer PROCYSBI at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Do not eat for at least 2 hours before taking PROCYSBI and for at least 30 minutes after to maximize absorption. If patients are unable to take PROCYSBI without eating, take with food and limit the amount of food to approximately 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) within 1 hour before taking PROCYSBI through 1 hour after taking PROCYSBI. Take PROCYSBI in a consistent manner in regard to food. Avoid high fat food close to dosing of PROCYSBI. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking PROCYSBI [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Oral Administration in Food or Liquid Administration of PROCYSBI capsules or oral granules with foods and liquids not included below has not been studied clinically and is not recommended. Administration in Applesauce or Berry Jelly: Place approximately 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) or a smaller amount that can be consumed in one feeding of either applesauce or berry jelly into a clean container. Open the capsule(s) or packet(s). Sprinkle all the intact granules that are inside the capsule(s) or packet(s) on applesauce or berry jelly. Mix the granules with the applesauce or berry jelly. Do not crush the granules. Consume the entire contents within 30 minutes of mixing. Do not chew the granules. Do not save the applesauce or berry jelly and granules for later use. Administration in Fruit Juice (except grapefruit juice): Pour approximately 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) of fruit juice into a clean cup. Open the capsule(s) or packet(s). Sprinkle all the intact granules into the juice. Gently stir until mixed. Do not crush the granules. Drink the entire contents within 30 minutes of mixing. Do not chew the granules. Do not save the fruit juice and granules mixture for later use. Administration in Applesauce via a Gastrostomy (G) Tube (14 French or larger) A bolus (straight) feeding tube is recommended. Flush the gastrostomy tube button first with 5 mL of water to clear the button. Open the capsule(s) or packet(s) and empty the granules into a clean container with approximately 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) of applesauce. Use only strained applesauce with no chunks. A minimum of 1 ounce (\u215bcup) of applesauce may be used for children 25 kg or less starting PROCYSBI at a dose of 1 or 2 capsules or packets. Mix the intact granules into the applesauce. Do not crush the granules. Draw up the mixture into a syringe. Keep the feeding tube horizontal during administration and apply rapid and steady pressure (10 mL/10 seconds) to dispense the syringe contents into the tube within 30 minutes of preparation. Repeat step 3 until all of the mixture is administered. Do not save the applesauce and granule mixture for later use. Draw up a minimum of 10 mL of fruit juice or water into another syringe, swirl gently, and flush the tube. Missed Doses If a dose is missed, take the dose as soon as possible up to 8 hours after the scheduled time. However, if a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is due in less than 4 hours, do not take the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at one time to make up for a missed dose."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome: Reduce dosage if skin and bone lesions occur. ( 5.1 ) Skin Rash: Discontinue if severe skin rash such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis occurs. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding: Monitor for GI symptoms and consider decreasing the dose if severe symptoms occur. ( 5.3 ) Fibrosing Colonopathy: Evaluate patients with severe, persistent, and/or worsening abdominal symptoms for fibrosing colonopathy. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue PROCYSBI and switch to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsules ( 5.4 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Symptoms: Monitor for CNS symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for severe symptoms or those that persist or progress ( 5.5 ). Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels: Monitor white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase levels; decrease or discontinue the dose until values revert to normal. ( 5.6 ) Benign Intracranial Hypertension: Monitor for signs and symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for signs/symptoms that persist, or discontinue if diagnosis is confirmed. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome Skin and bone lesions that resemble clinical findings for Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome have been reported in patients treated with high doses of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts. These include molluscoid pseudotumors (purplish hemorrhagic lesions), skin striae, bone lesions (including osteopenia, compression fractures, scoliosis and genu valgum), leg pain, and joint hyperextension. One patient on immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate with serious skin lesions subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. Monitor patients for development of skin or bone lesions and interrupt PROCYSBI dosing if patients develop these lesions. PROCYSBI may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, then slowly increase to the appropriate therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.4) ] . 5.2 Skin Rash Severe skin rashes such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. If severe skin rashes develop, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Gastrointestinal Ulcers and Bleeding Gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. GI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain, sometimes severe, have been associated with cysteamine. If severe GI tract symptoms develop, consider decreasing the dose of PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.4) ] . 5.4 Fibrosing Colonopathy Fibrosing colonopathy, including colonic stricture formation, has been reported with postmarketing use of PROCYSBI in pediatric and young adult patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Some of these patients had been treated with PROCYSBI for prolonged periods of time. Reported symptoms include: abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody or persistent diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. Evaluate patients with severe, persistent, and/or worsening abdominal symptoms for fibrosing colonopathy. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue PROCYSBI and switch to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsules. An association between methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer (an inactive ingredient in PROCYSBI) and fibrosing colonopathy cannot be ruled out. 5.5 Central Nervous System Symptoms Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Neurological complications have also been described in some patients with cystinosis who have not been treated with cysteamine. Carefully evaluate and monitor patients who develop CNS symptoms. Interrupt medication or adjust the dose as necessary for patients with severe symptoms or with symptoms that persist or progress. Inform patients that PROCYSBI may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 5.6 Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels. If tests values remain elevated, consider decreasing the dose or discontinuing the drug until values revert to normal. 5.7 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of PTC, including headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurry vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. If signs/symptoms persist, interrupt dosing or decrease the dose and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling: Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Skin Rash [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Fibrosing Colonopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Central Nervous System Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Leukopenia and/or Elevated Phosphatase Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Benign Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions in: Patients 6 years of age and older previously treated with cysteamine (\u22655%) are: vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, breath odor, diarrhea, skin odor, fatigue, rash, and headache. ( 6.1 ) Patients 1 year to less than 6 years na\u00efve to cysteamine treatment (>10%) are: vomiting, gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis, diarrhea, breath odor, nausea, electrolyte imbalance and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1 800 77 AMGEN (1 800 772 6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to cysteamine in 345 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (246 patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine as cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine, and 80 patients receiving PROCYSBI) in open-label clinical trials. Clinical Trials Experience with PROCYSBI in Patients Switched from Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate Sixty-two patients with nephropathic cystinosis (38 males and 24 females) received PROCYSBI in two clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.29 grams/m 2 per day to 2.19 grams/m 2 per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. All patients were switched from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI. Forty-three patients, ages 6 to 26 years old, received PROCYSBI in an 8-week, open-label, randomized, cross-over trial comparing PROCYSBI to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Forty of 43 patients continued PROCYSBI treatment in an open-label extension trial (36 patients were treated with PROCYSBI for longer than 2 years, and 20 patients were treated for longer than 5 years). An additional 19 patients (6 renal transplanted patients and 13 patients aged 2 to 6 years) were enrolled directly into this trial (12 patients were treated with PROCYSBI for longer than 2 years, and 9 patients were treated for longer than 5 years). In the open-label, randomized, cross-over trial, a higher incidence of adverse reactions was reported in patients during the PROCYSBI treatment period compared with the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment period (see Table 2 ). Other significant adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Table 2: Adverse Reactions in \u22655% of Patients with Nephropathic Cystinosis in a Randomized, Cross-Over Trial Adverse Reaction Immediate-Release Cysteamine PROCYSBI (n = 41) % (n = 43) % Vomiting/emesis 12 19 Nausea 7 16 Abdominal pain/discomfort 0 14 Headache 0 9 Dizziness 0 5 Anorexia/loss of appetite 5 2 In the open-label extension trial (N=59), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>15%) were vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, conjunctivitis, influenza, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, dehydration, ear infection, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, arthralgia, cough, and pain in extremity. Clinical Trials Experience with PROCYSBI in Cysteamine-Na\u00efve Patients Seventeen cysteamine-na\u00efve patients (fifteen patients between the ages of 1 and 5 years, one 9-year old and one 22-year old) received PROCYSBI in an open-label clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 2 patients (>10%) were: gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis (n=6), vomiting (n=4), and electrolyte imbalance (n=2). Three patients with serious adverse reactions of gastroenteritis also had dehydration. Common adverse reactions reported at a frequency of >10% (occurring in at least 2 patients) are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in >10% of Patients with Nephropathic Cystinosis Na\u00efve to Cysteamine Treatment in an Open-Label Trial Adverse Reaction PROCYSBI N = 17 n (%) Vomiting 13 (77) Gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis 9 (53) Diarrhea 6 (35) Breath odor 4 (24) Nausea 3 (18) Electrolyte imbalance 2 (12) Headache 2 (12) Clinical Trials Experience with Immediate-Release Cysteamine The most frequent adverse reactions involved the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems and were especially prominent at the initiation of cysteamine therapy. Most patients were able to resume therapy at lower doses. The most common reactions (>5%) were vomiting, anorexia, fever, diarrhea, lethargy, and rash. Other adverse reactions included nausea, bad breath, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and urticaria. Withdrawals due to intolerance, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and fever occurred more frequently in those patients receiving 1.95 grams/m 2 per day as compared with 1.3 grams/m 2 per day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of cysteamine bitartrate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal: Joint hyperextension, leg pain, osteopenia, compression fracture, scoliosis, genu valgum [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Skin : Erythema multiforme bullosa, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome, molluscoid pseudotumors, skin striae, skin fragility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal: Fibrosing colonopathy reported with PROCYSBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Central Nervous System : seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression and encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] , benign intracranial hypertension (or PTC) and/or papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Increase Gastric pH Drugs that increase the gastric pH (e.g., medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate) may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Concomitant administration of 20 mg omeprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine when PROCYSBI was administered with 240 mL of orange juice or with 240 mL of water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Monitor WBC cystine concentration when drugs that increase the gastric pH are concomitantly used [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 7.2 Use with Alcohol Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI. Therefore, do not consume alcoholic beverages during treatment with PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 7.3 Other Medications Used for the Management of Fanconi Syndrome PROCYSBI can be administered with other electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome, as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone."

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on PROCYSBI use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for birth defects or miscarriage [see Data ] . Cysteamine (administered as cysteamine bitartrate) was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats at doses less than the recommended human maintenance dose. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Data Animal Data Embryo-fetal development studies were conducted in rats using oral administration of cysteamine bitartrate, with a dose range of 37.5 to 150 mg/kg per day of cysteamine equivalent (about 0.2 to 0.7 times the recommended human maintenance dose based on body surface area). Cysteamine bitartrate was fetotoxic and produced adverse developmental effects. Observed teratogenic findings were cleft palate, kyphosis, heart ventricular septal defects, microcephaly and exencephaly. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of cysteamine in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cysteamine is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data ]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from cysteamine, breastfeeding is not recommended. Data A decrease in survival occurred in neonatal rats nursed by mothers receiving cysteamine [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PROCYSBI have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis. Use of PROCYSBI is supported by evidence from patients switched to PROCYSBI from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate in two trials: an open-label, randomized, cross-over trial in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older (n=43) and an open-label extension trial in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older (n=59). Another open-label trial was conducted in cysteamine na\u00efve pediatric patients 1 year to less than 6 years of age (n=15) [see Clinical Trials (14.2) ] . The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to adults. In patients less than 6 years of age, vomiting occurred in 12/15 cysteamine treatment na\u00efve patients compared to 11/13 patients switched from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI. The safety and effectiveness of PROCYSBI have not been established in patients less than 1 year of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use No studies with PROCYSBI have been conducted in geriatric patients."

A 16-year-old male patient suffered nausea and vomiting after he mistakenly took a second dose of PROCYSBI 30 minutes after his usual dose. Two cases of overdosing with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate have been reported in two patients. In the first case, the patient immediately vomited after ingesting an unknown dose and did not develop any symptoms. The second case involved an accidental ingestion of a 200 to 250 mg/kg dose by a healthy 13-month-old child. Vomiting and dehydration were experienced. The child was hospitalized and fluids were administered. The patient fully recovered from the overdosing. Should overdosing occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported appropriately. No specific antidote is known. Hemodialysis may be considered since cysteamine is poorly bound to plasma proteins."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION PROCYSBI, for oral administration, is a cystine-depleting agent that lowers the cystine content of cells in patients with nephropathic cystinosis, an inherited defect of lysosomal transport. PROCYSBI contains the bitartrate salt of cysteamine. The chemical name for cysteamine bitartrate is ethanethiol, 2-amino, (2 R ,3 R )-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1) (salt). Cysteamine bitartrate is a highly water soluble white powder with a molecular weight of 227.24 and the molecular formula C 2 H 7 NS \u2219 C 4 H 6 O 6 . It has the following chemical structure: Each PROCYSBI delayed-release capsule contains either 25 mg cysteamine (equivalent to 74 mg cysteamine bitartrate) or 75 mg cysteamine (equivalent to 221 mg cysteamine bitartrate). Each packet of PROCYSBI delayed-release oral granules contains either 75 mg cysteamine (equivalent to 221 mg cysteamine bitartrate) or 300 mg cysteamine (equivalent to 884 mg cysteamine bitartrate). PROCYSBI delayed release granules contain the following inactive ingredients: Eudragit \u00ae L 30 D-55 (methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer), hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, purified water, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, and triethyl citrate. Additionally the capsule shell contains the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, ink (blue and white), and titanium dioxide. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Cysteamine is an aminothiol that participates within lysosomes in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction converting cystine into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome in patients with cystinosis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Normal individuals and persons heterozygous for cystinosis have WBC cystine concentrations of less than 0.2 and usually below 1 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein, respectively, when measured using the mixed leukocyte assay. Untreated patients with nephropathic cystinosis have elevations of WBC cystine concentration above 2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein. After the administration of a single dose of PROCYSBI, peak concentrations of cysteamine were observed at 3 hours post-dose. The nadir of WBC cystine closely followed the peak concentrations at 3.5 hours post-dose, and returned to baseline WBC concentrations at 12 hours-post dose. The cystine concentration in WBC lysate was measured with LC/MS/MS and total protein content in human WBC lysate was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. A correction factor was applied to the total protein content for the difference in results from the Lowry method. The cystine concentration in nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein was calculated by multiplying nmol cystine/mg protein by 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of PROCYSBI were evaluated in 43 patients age ranged from 6 to 26 years (mean age 12 years) with cystinosis and with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of greater than 30 mL/minutes/1.73 m2. Table 4 shows the mean pharmacokinetic parameters for PROCYSBI and immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate at steady state. The mean (\u00b1 SD) dose for PROCYSBI was 656 \u00b1 144 mg/m2 (given every 12 hours) and for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate was 404 \u00b1 88 mg/m2 (given every 6 hours). Table 4: Pharmacokinetic parameters for cysteamine at steady state* after administration of PROCYSBI or immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate Immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate given every 6 hours PROCYSBI given every 12 hours C max (mg/L) 2.7 \u00b1 1.4 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 AUC 0-6h (min*mg/L) 351 \u00b1 153 NA AUC 0-12h (min*mg/L) NA 726 \u00b1 339 AUC inf (min*mg/L) 380 \u00b1 157 785 \u00b1 358 T max (min) 73 \u00b1 31 188 \u00b1 88 t\u00bd (min) 90 \u00b1 24 253 \u00b1 403 CL/F (L/min) 1.4 \u00b1 0.8 1.2 \u00b1 0.8 Vd/F (L) 198 \u00b1 159 382 \u00b1 404 Absorption The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of PROCYSBI are consistent with a delayed-release formulation; the mean T max for cysteamine was 188 minutes with PROCYSBI compared with 73 minutes for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. The mean plasma cysteamine peak and AUC were similar when a single PROCYSBI dose of 600 mg was administered with 240 mL orange juice or with 240 mL water. The systemic exposure to cysteamine was similar when PROCYSBI was administered with orange juice as a whole capsule and sprinkled in applesauce in the fasted state. In a food effect study conducted in healthy subjects (n=20), administration of a meal 30 minutes following PROCYSBI administration (intact capsules) decreased C max by 34% and AUC 0-t by 32% compared to administration of a meal 2 hours post-dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Distribution Cysteamine was moderately bound to human plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin, with mean protein binding of about 52%. Plasma protein binding was independent of concentration over the concentration range achieved clinically with the recommended doses. The volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 382 L for PROCYSBI compared with 198 L for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Elimination After each dose of PROCYSBI the cysteamine concentration in the blood continues to decline for approximately 30 minutes and the WBC cystine concentration increases accordingly . The apparent clearance (Cl/F) of cysteamine was similar between PROCYSBI (1.2 \u00b1 0.8 L/min) and immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate (1.4 \u00b1 0.8 L/min). The half-life was 253 minutes for PROCYSBI and 90 minutes for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Specific Populations Pediatric patients 1 year to less than 6 years of age The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of PROCYSBI at steady state were evaluated in 11 cysteamine treatment na\u00efve patients between the ages of 1 and 5 years of age with nephropathic cystinosis. A mean (\u00b1 SD) C max of 1.26 \u00b1 0.86 mg/L was reached at an average T max of 199 \u00b1 138 minutes and the mean (\u00b1 SD) dose was 242 \u00b1 93 mg/m 2 . The mean exposure was calculated to be 206 \u00b1 113 minutes*mg/L (AUC last ) and 231 \u00b1 123 minutes*mg/L (AUC inf ). The mean CL ss /F was estimated to be 0.69 \u00b1 0.37 L/minutes with an average half-life (t \u00bd ) of 270 \u00b1 56 minutes. Overall, the pharmacokinetics in patients between the ages of 1 and 5 years of age is comparable with those in older children and adults. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of a single oral dose of 600 mg PROCYSBI were evaluated in non-cystinosis subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects with normal renal function (eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) matched for age, body mass index and sex. The mean AUC inf and mean C max for cysteamine were 8%, and 3% lower, respectively, in subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to healthy subjects. In subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and severe renal impairment (\u226429 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the mean AUC inf was 49% and 35% higher and the mean C max was 27% and 11% higher, respectively compared to healthy subjects. The mean t\u00bd was 7 hours, 8.3 hours, and 8.8 hours in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively and ranged from 6.6 to 7.5 hours in healthy subjects. The mean CL/F was 1.57, 1.08, and 1.09 L/min in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment subjects compared to 1.40 to 1.60 L/min in healthy subjects. In subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving 4 hours of hemodialysis, the geometric mean C max and AUC inf of cysteamine was 60% higher when PROCYSBI was administered 3 hours before hemodialysis, and 22% higher when administered 1 hour after completion of hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects. Approximately 4.3% (25.6 mg) of the 600 mg PROCYSBI dose was removed from the body with hemodialysis. The apparent clearance of cysteamine in subjects who received PROCYSBI before hemodialysis was approximately 65 mL/min. The increased exposure to cysteamine in patients with renal impairment compared to healthy subjects is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). The potential for cysteamine to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs via these enzymes is low. Omeprazole The effect of concomitant omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine was evaluated following co-administration of single PROCYSBI dose of 600 mg with 20 mg of omeprazole in comparison to administration of PROCYSBI alone in healthy subjects in two separate studies. In both studies omeprazole was dosed once daily for 5 days before co-administration with PROCYSBI and single dose PROCYSBI was given either with 240 mL orange juice in one study or with 240 mL water in another study. The pharmacokinetic parameters of cysteamine were not significantly different when PROCYSBI was administered with omeprazole compared to when PROCYSBI was administered alone, regardless whether PROCYSI was administered with orange juice or water [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

The mean t\u00bd was 7 hours, 8.3 hours, and 8.8 hours in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively and ranged from 6.6 to 7.5 hours in healthy subjects. The mean CL/F was 1.57, 1.08, and 1.09 L/min in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment subjects compared to 1.40 to 1.60 L/min in healthy subjects. In subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving 4 hours of hemodialysis, the geometric mean C max and AUC inf of cysteamine was 60% higher when PROCYSBI was administered 3 hours before hemodialysis, and 22% higher when administered 1 hour after completion of hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects. Approximately 4.3% (25.6 mg) of the 600 mg PROCYSBI dose was removed from the body with hemodialysis. The apparent clearance of cysteamine in subjects who received PROCYSBI before hemodialysis was approximately 65 mL/min. The increased exposure to cysteamine in patients with renal impairment compared to healthy subjects is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). The potential for cysteamine to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs via these enzymes is low. Omeprazole The effect of concomitant omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine was evaluated following co-administration of single PROCYSBI dose of 600 mg with 20 mg of omeprazole in comparison to administration of PROCYSBI alone in healthy subjects in two separate studies. In both studies omeprazole was dosed once daily for 5 days before co-administration with PROCYSBI and single dose PROCYSBI was given either with 240 mL orange juice in one study or with 240 mL water in another study. The pharmacokinetic parameters of cysteamine were not significantly different when PROCYSBI was administered with omeprazole compared to when PROCYSBI was administered alone, regardless whether PROCYSI was administered with orange juice or water [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Trials with Immediate-Release Cysteamine Efficacy of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate was demonstrated in open-label clinical trials of cysteamine hydrochloride and phosphocysteamine. An open-label clinical trial of cysteamine hydrochloride was conducted in 94 pediatric patients (mainly from the United States) with nephropathic cystinosis. Patients were treated with increasing doses of cysteamine hydrochloride (mean dose 54 mg/kg per day) to attain WBC cystine concentrations of less than 2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose. The clinical outcomes were compared with a historical control group of 17 pediatric patients who had been in the placebo group of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of ascorbic acid. Cysteamine-treated patients had been diagnosed at a mean age of 22 months and had a mean age of 46 months old at study entry; placebo patients had been diagnosed at about 29 months and had a mean age of about 52 months old at trial entry. The principal measures of effectiveness were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth (height). The average median WBC cystine concentration during treatment was 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein. There were 70 cysteamine-treated patients with a baseline serum creatinine of less than 2 mg/dL who were followed for at least 1 year, and 17 placebo patients. Twelve of the 94 cysteamine-treated patients required early dialysis or renal transplant. Median follow-up of cysteamine patients was over 32 months, and 20% were followed more than 5 years. Median follow-up of the placebo group was 20 months; only 1 patient was followed more than 24 months. Glomerular function among cysteamine-treated patients was maintained over time. Placebo-treated patients experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Renal tubular function was not affected by treatment. Calculated creatinine clearances were evaluated for two groups of pediatric patients, one with poor WBC cystine depletion (defined as median WBC cystine concentrations greater than 3 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein or WBC cystine concentrations not measured at least 2 times per year) and one with good WBC cystine depletion. The final mean creatinine clearance of the good depletion group was 20.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 greater than the mean for the poor-depletion group. Height-for-age measurements of treated patients were compared with height-for-age measurements of 143 patients initially screened for inclusion in the trial. Patients on treatment maintained growth (i.e., did not show increasing growth failure compared with normal scales) although growth velocity did not increase enough to allow patients to catch up to age norms for height. In another open-label clinical trial, 46 patients who had completed the clinical trial of cysteamine hydrochloride (averaging 6.5 years of treatment) and 93 treatment na\u00efve patients were treated with either cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine (patient's choice). Patients had cystinosis diagnosed by elevated WBC cystine (mean 3.63 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg). Newly enrolled patients and the 46 continuing patients were required to have serum creatinine less than 3 mg/dL and 4 mg/dL, respectively. Patients were randomized to doses of 1.3 or 1.95 grams/m 2 per day and stratified according to whether the serum creatinine was above 1.2 mg/dL or not. Doses could be raised if WBC cystine concentrations were approximately 2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein and lowered due to intolerance. The mean age of the newly enrolled patients was about 49 months for the cysteamine group and about 34 months for the phosphocysteamine group. The mean age of the patients in the long-term follow-up group was about 9 years. Mean doses were 1.27 grams/m 2 per day and 1.87 grams/m 2 per day in the two groups and WBC cystine concentrations averaged 1.72 \u00b1 1.65 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein and 1.86 \u00b1 0.92 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein in the 1.3 grams/m 2 per day and 1.95 grams/m 2 per day in the two groups, respectively. In new patients, serum creatinine was essentially unchanged over the period of follow-up (about half of the patients were followed for 24 months) and phosphocysteamine and cysteamine hydrochloride had similar effects. The long-term follow-up group also had essentially no change in renal function (almost 80% were followed at least 2 years). In four studies of patients with untreated cystinosis, renal death (need for transplant or dialysis) occurred at median age of less than 10 years. Both new patients and patients in the long-term follow-up group maintained height (although they did not catch up from baseline). There was no apparent difference in height maintenance between the two doses. 14.2 Clinical Trials with PROCYSBI Multi-Center, Open-Label, Randomized Clinical Trial in Patients Receiving Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate A clinical trial comparing immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate and PROCYSBI was conducted in 43 (40 pediatric and 3 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis (Study RP103-03; NCT01000961). Patient age ranged from 6 to 26 years (mean age 12 years) and 56% were male. Patients with WBC cystine concentrations greater than 2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein (measured using the mixed leukocyte assay) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR corrected for body surface area) less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 at the time of screening were excluded from the trial. Prior to randomization, patients were to be on a stable dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered every six hours. PROCYSBI dose adjustments of up to approximately 100% of the total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate were allowed by trial criteria. The average total daily dose of PROCYSBI for patients completing the clinical trial was approximately 91% of the average total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate for patients at trial entry. This trial demonstrated that at steady-state, PROCYSBI administered every 12 hours was non-inferior to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered every 6 hours with respect to the depletion of WBC cystine concentrations (Table 5). Using a linear mixed effects statistical analysis model, the least-square-mean value of WBC cystine was 0.52 \u00b1 0.06 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein after 12 hours under PROCYSBI and 0.44 \u00b1 0.06 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein after 6 hours under immediate-release cysteamine; a difference of 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein (95.8% Confidence Interval = 0.01 to 0.15). Table 5: Comparison of WBC cystine concentrations in open-label, randomized, cross-over clinical trial participants, who were on a stable dose of immediate-release cysteamine prior to randomization, with WBC cystine less than 2 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein throughout the trial Per\u2013Protocol (PP) Population (N=39) Immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate PROCYSBI WBC cystine concentration in nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein (LS Mean \u00b1 SE) 0.44 \u00b1 0.06 0.52 \u00b1 0.06 Difference in Treatment effect (LS mean \u00b1 SE) [95.8% CI; p-value] 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 [0.01 to 0.15; <0.0001] Multi-Center, Single-Arm, Open-Label, Long-Term Extension Clinical Trial of PROCYSBI Forty of the 41 patients completing the randomized trial continued treatment with PROCYSBI in an open-label extension trial, for a total treatment duration ranging from 1 month to 6.7 years in the study (Study RP103-03-04; NCT01197378). Thirty-six of the 40 patients continued treatment with PROCYSBI for at least 24 months and 20 patients continued treatment for longer than 60 months in the extension trial, and maintained their mean WBC cystine concentrations below 1 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein (measured using the mixed leukocyte assay) over this time period. Thirteen pediatric patients, aged 2 to 6 years, were also enrolled in the extension trial and treated with PROCYSBI. All of them were on treatment with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate at the time of enrollment. All 13 patients received at least 18 months of treatment with PROCYSBI, and their mean \u00b1 SD WBC cystine concentration (measured using the mixed leukocyte assay) decreased from 1.41 \u00b1 1.03 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein at baseline to 1.22 \u00b1 1.40 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein after 18 months of treatment. Seven of these pediatric patients were able to achieve a WBC cystine concentration (measured using the mixed leukocyte assay) of less than 1.0 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein after 18 months of treatment; their mean \u00b1 SD dose of PROCYSBI increased from 0.81 \u00b1 0.25 grams/m 2 per day at baseline to 0.90 \u00b1 0.25 grams/m 2 per day after 18 months of treatment. During extended treatment with PROCYSBI, mean estimates of renal function, as measured by the eGFR, were maintained. Multi-Center, Open-Label, Clinical Trial in Cysteamine Na\u00efve Patients Less than 6 Years of Age A clinical trial of PROCYSBI (Study RP103-08; NCT01744782) was conducted in 17 patients with a documented diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis who were na\u00efve to cysteamine treatment (15 patients between the ages of 1 and 5 years, one 9-year old and one 22-year old). The PROCYSBI starting dose was \u00bc the maintenance dose of 1 gram/m 2 /day (actual dosing was based on weight bands using the available capsule strengths, as shown in (Table 1) and the dosage was gradually increased by 10% every 2 weeks. Dosage adjustment was allowed throughout the trial and was based on subject-specific factors (e.g., weight, tolerability) and WBC cystine concentrations. WBC cystine concentrations were obtained 30 minutes after the morning dose collected bi-monthly until the patient's WBC cystine concentration (using the mixed leukocyte assay) was < 1 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein. Treatment duration was at least 12 months. Fourteen of the 15 patients between 1 year and less than 6 years of age completed 12 months of treatment, and 10 patients completed 18 months of treatment. Thirteen of the 14 patients achieved their highest total daily dosage of PROCYSBI following the 9-month visit (9-month visit for 8 subjects, 12-month visit for 4 subjects, and 18-month visit for 1 subject). Some patients did not have WBC cystine samples collected at each visit or results were not reportable due to laboratory errors. Thus, the numbers of patients with available WBC cystine data varied across the time points analyzed. In patients with missing samples, dose escalation was continued if the patient's last reported WBC cystine concentration was > 1 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein. In patients 1 year to less than 6 years, the mean (\u00b1SD) WBC cystine concentration on Day 1, 30 minutes following the first dose, was 3.17\u00b12.95 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein (n=15 patients). At 12 months (13 patients with samples), the mean WBC cystine concentration was 0.80 \u00b1 0.60 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein at 30 minutes post dose. At 18 months (9 patients with samples) the mean WBC cystine concentration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.64 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein at 30 minutes post dose. In patients 1 year to less than 6 years, the mean (\u00b1SD) weight percentiles at Day 1 (n=14), 12 months (n=13) and 18 months (n=10) were 3.5 \u00b1 11.1, 11.9 \u00b1 18.3, and 30.1 \u00b1 28.2, respectively, and patient weight z-scores were -4.0 \u00b1 2.1, -2.2 \u00b1 1.7, and -1.3 \u00b1 2.0, respectively. In the same patients, similar trends were observed for height."

Revised: 12/2024 What is PROCYSBI? PROCYSBI is a prescription medicine used to treat nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children 1 year of age and older. It is not known if PROCYSBI is safe and effective in children under 1 year of age. Do not take PROCYSBI if you are allergic to penicillamine or cysteamine. Before taking PROCYSBI, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you : drink alcohol. have a skin rash or bone problems. have or have had stomach or bowel (intestinal) problems including ulcers or bleeding. have a history of seizures, lack of energy, unusual sleepiness, depression, or changes in your ability to think clearly. have liver or blood problems. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if PROCYSBI will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think that you are pregnant. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking PROCYSBI during pregnancy. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You should not breastfeed during treatment with PROCYSBI. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take PROCYSBI. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take PROCYSBI? Read the \" Instructions for Use \" that comes with PROCYSBI for information about the right way to prepare and take PROCYSBI. Take PROCYSBI exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of PROCYSBI and slowly increase your dose to help avoid side effects, especially if you have not taken a medicine that contains cysteamine bitartrate before.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in which the transport of cystine out of lysosomes is abnormal; in the nephropathic form, accumulation of cystine and formation of crystals damage various organs, especially the kidney, leading to renal tubular Fanconi Syndrome and progressive glomerular failure, with end stage renal failure by the end of the first decade of life. In four studies of cystinosis patients before cysteamine was available, renal death (need for transplant or dialysis) occurred at median age of less than 10 years. Patients with cystinosis also experience growth failure, rickets, and photophobia due to cystine deposits in the cornea. With time most organs are damaged, including the retina, muscles and central nervous system. Cysteamine is an aminothiol that participates within lysosomes in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction converting cystine into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome in patients with cystinosis. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Normal individuals and persons heterozygous for cystinosis have white cell cystine levels of < 0.2 and usually below 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein, respectively. Individuals with nephropathic cystinosis have elevations of white cell cystine above 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. White cell cystine is monitored in these patients to determine adequacy of dosing, levels being measured 5 to 6 hours after dosing. In the Long-Term Study (see Clinical Trials , below) entry white cell cystine levels were 3.73 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein (range 0.13 to 19.80 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein) and were maintained close to 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein with a cysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/m 2 /day. After administration of cysteamine HCl, leukocyte cystine levels fall, with minimum levels at approximately 1 hour. Because cysteamine HCl has an unpleasant taste and odor, other formulations have been developed, including phosphocysteamine, the phosphorothioester of cysteamine that is rapidly converted to cysteamine in the gut, and cysteamine bitartrate (CYSTAGON \u00ae ). Cysteamine bitartrate has been shown in a transfer study in 8 patients to maintain white cell cystine levels below 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein when substituted for cysteamine HCl or phosphocysteamine. Total cysteamine levels 2 and 6 hours post-dosing were higher after cysteamine bitartrate than for the solutions. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CYSTAGON \u00ae were studied in eleven pediatric patients with nephropathic cystinosis who received 225 to 550 mg of cysteamine bitartrate every 6 hours daily for more than one year. Following repeated oral administration of 225 to 550 mg cysteamine bitartrate, the mean time to maximum plasma concentration (T max ) occurred at about 1.4 hours post dose with mean steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2.6 \u00b5g/mL and 6.3 \u00b5g\u2219hr/mL, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution and apparent plasma clearance of cysteamine were 156 L and 1.2 L/min, respectively. Cysteamine was moderately bound to human plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin, with mean protein binding of about 52%. Plasma protein binding was independent of concentration over the concentration range achieved clinically with the recommended doses. The pharmacodynamic response increased with the plasma cysteamine concentration, with maximum response occurring approximately 1.8 hours post dose with an average reduction of white cell cystine concentration of about 0.46 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and returning to baseline level 6 hours post dose. The mean white cell cystine concentration and mean cysteamine plasma concentration-time profile is shown below: Most clinical data have been developed using cysteamine HCl or phosphocysteamine solutions. In all discussions that follow, administered amounts of various cysteamine salts will be expressed as amounts of cysteamine free base. The mean white cell cystine concentration and mean cysteamine plasma concentration-time profile Clinical Studies There are approximately 200 pre-transplant cystinosis patients in the United States with nephropathic cystinosis and clinical studies have included almost all of them, in addition to about 40 studied in the United Kingdom. For all patients, mean age at entry into studies was just under 4 years. Patients were approximately equally divided between genders and about 85% were white, 9% were black, and 3% were hispanic. The National Collaborative Cysteamine Study (NCCS) treated 94 children (mainly from the United States) with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine HCl (mean dose 54 mg/kg/day) to attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, and compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children who had been in the placebo group of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of ascorbic acid. Cysteamine treated patients had been diagnosed at a mean age of 22 months and were a mean age of 46 months old at study entry; placebo patients had been diagnosed at about 29 months and were a mean age of about 52 months old at study entry. The principal measures of effectiveness were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth (height). The average median white cell cystine level attained during treatment in the NCCS was 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. There were 70 cysteamine patients with baseline serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dL who were followed for at least a year and 17 placebo patients. Twelve of the 94 cysteamine treated patients required early dialysis or renal transplant. Median follow-up of cysteamine patients was over 32 months and 20% were followed more than 5 years. For the placebo group median follow-up was 20 months and only one was followed more than 24 months. Among cysteamine patients glomerular function was maintained over time despite the longer period of treatment and follow-up. Placebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Height, corrected for age, was compared for treated patients with the height, at the various ages patients appeared, of the 143 patients initially screened for inclusion in the NCCS. Patients on treatment maintained growth (did not show increasing growth failure compared to normals) although growth velocity did not increase enough to allow patients to catch up to age norms. Renal tubular function was not affected by treatment. Calculated creatinine clearances were evaluated for two groups of children, one with poor white cell cystine depletion and one with good white cell cystine depletion as shown in Table I. The final mean creatinine clearance of the good depletion group was 20.8 ml/min/1.73 m 2 greater than the mean for the poor depletion group, despite the older mean age of the good depletion group.

Poor Depletion Median leukocyte cystine levels were over 3 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein or were not measured at least 2 times per year. Patients did receive cysteamine for at least 1 year. (n = 18) 4.2 \u00b1 1.8 6.5 \u00b1 0.5 33.6 \u00b1 17.0 29.7 \u00b1 5.4 Good Depletion Median leukocyte cystine levels were less than 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and received cysteamine for at least 1 year. (n = 19) 3.3 \u00b1 2.2 7.2 \u00b1 0.7 44.3 \u00b1 15.0 50.5 \u00b1 5.1 The Long Term Study, initiated in 1988, utilized both cysteamine HCl and phosphocysteamine (patient\u2019s choice) in 46 patients who had completed the NCCS (averaging 6.5 years of treatment) and 93 new patients. Patients had cystinosis diagnosed by elevated white cell cystine (mean 3.63 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg). New patients and 46 continuing patients were required to have serum creatinine less than 3.0 mg/dL and 4.0 mg/dL, respectively. Patients were randomized to doses of 1.3 or 1.95 g/m 2 /day and stratified according to whether the serum creatinine was above 1.2 mg/dL or not. Doses could be raised if white cell cystine levels were approximately 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and lowered due to intolerance. Mean doses were 1.27 g/m 2 /day and 1.87 g/m 2 /day in the two groups and white cell cystine levels averaged 1.72 \u00b1 1.65 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and 1.86 \u00b1 0.92 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein in the 1.3 and 1.95 g/m 2 /day groups, respectively. In new patients, a group similar in age to the NCCS group, serum creatinine was essentially unchanged over the period of follow-up (about half of the patients were followed for 24 months) and phosphocysteamine and cysteamine HCl had similar effects. The long-term follow-up group, about nine years old on average at entry, stayed in the study (almost 80% were followed at least 2 years) and had essentially no change in renal function. In four studies of untreated cystinosis, renal death (need for transplant or dialysis) occurred at median age of less than 10 years. Both groups maintained height (although they did not catch up from baseline). There was no apparent difference between the two doses."

      "Clinical Studies There are approximately 200 pre-transplant cystinosis patients in the United States with nephropathic cystinosis and clinical studies have included almost all of them, in addition to about 40 studied in the United Kingdom. For all patients, mean age at entry into studies was just under 4 years. Patients were approximately equally divided between genders and about 85% were white, 9% were black, and 3% were hispanic. The National Collaborative Cysteamine Study (NCCS) treated 94 children (mainly from the United States) with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine HCl (mean dose 54 mg/kg/day) to attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, and compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children who had been in the placebo group of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of ascorbic acid. Cysteamine treated patients had been diagnosed at a mean age of 22 months and were a mean age of 46 months old at study entry; placebo patients had been diagnosed at about 29 months and were a mean age of about 52 months old at study entry. The principal measures of effectiveness were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth (height). The average median white cell cystine level attained during treatment in the NCCS was 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. There were 70 cysteamine patients with baseline serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dL who were followed for at least a year and 17 placebo patients. Twelve of the 94 cysteamine treated patients required early dialysis or renal transplant. Median follow-up of cysteamine patients was over 32 months and 20% were followed more than 5 years. For the placebo group median follow-up was 20 months and only one was followed more than 24 months. Among cysteamine patients glomerular function was maintained over time despite the longer period of treatment and follow-up. Placebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Height, corrected for age, was compared for treated patients with the height, at the various ages patients appeared, of the 143 patients initially screened for inclusion in the NCCS. Patients on treatment maintained growth (did not show increasing growth failure compared to normals) although growth velocity did not increase enough to allow patients to catch up to age norms. Renal tubular function was not affected by treatment. Calculated creatinine clearances were evaluated for two groups of children, one with poor white cell cystine depletion and one with good white cell cystine depletion as shown in Table I. The final mean creatinine clearance of the good depletion group was 20.8 ml/min/1.73 m 2 greater than the mean for the poor depletion group, despite the older mean age of the good depletion group. TABLE 1: CREATININE CLEARANCE CHANGES BY WHITE CELL CYSTINE DEPLETION Age (years) Creatinine Clearance (ml/min/1.73m 2 ) Initial Final Initial Final (95% confidence limits on difference between final creatinine clearances, 6.1 and 35.5 ml/min/1.73m 2 , despite older mean age of good depletion group.) Poor Depletion Median leukocyte cystine levels were over 3 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein or were not measured at least 2 times per year. Patients did receive cysteamine for at least 1 year. (n = 18) 4.2 \u00b1 1.8 6.5 \u00b1 0.5 33.6 \u00b1 17.0 29.7 \u00b1 5.4 Good Depletion Median leukocyte cystine levels were less than 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and received cysteamine for at least 1 year. (n = 19) 3.3 \u00b1 2.2 7.2 \u00b1 0.7 44.3 \u00b1 15.0 50.5 \u00b1 5.1 The Long Term Study, initiated in 1988, utilized both cysteamine HCl and phosphocysteamine (patient\u2019s choice) in 46 patients who had completed the NCCS (averaging 6.5 years of treatment) and 93 new patients. Patients had cystinosis diagnosed by elevated white cell cystine (mean 3.63 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg). New patients and 46 continuing patients were required to have serum creatinine less than 3.0 mg/dL and 4.0 mg/dL, respectively. Patients were randomized to doses of 1.3 or 1.95 g/m 2 /day and stratified according to whether the serum creatinine was above 1.2 mg/dL or not. Doses could be raised if white cell cystine levels were approximately 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and lowered due to intolerance. Mean doses were 1.27 g/m 2 /day and 1.87 g/m 2 /day in the two groups and white cell cystine levels averaged 1.72 \u00b1 1.65 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein and 1.86 \u00b1 0.92 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein in the 1.3 and 1.95 g/m 2 /day groups, respectively. In new patients, a group similar in age to the NCCS group, serum creatinine was essentially unchanged over the period of follow-up (about half of the patients were followed for 24 months) and phosphocysteamine and cysteamine HCl had similar effects. The long-term follow-up group, about nine years old on average at entry, stayed in the study (almost 80% were followed at least 2 years) and had essentially no change in renal function. In four studies of untreated cystinosis, renal death (need for transplant or dialysis) occurred at median age of less than 10 years. Both groups maintained height (although they did not catch up from baseline). There was no apparent difference between the two doses."

      "WARNINGS If a skin rash develops, CYSTAGON \u00ae should be withheld until the rash clears. CYSTAGON \u00ae may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, then slowly titrated to the therapeutic dose. If a severe skin rash develops such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis, CYSTAGON \u00ae should not be readministered. CNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with cysteamine. If CNS symptoms develop, the patient should be carefully evaluated and the dose adjusted as necessary. Neurological complications have been described in some cystinotic patients not on cysteamine treatment. This may be a manifestation of the primary disorder. Patients should not engage in hazardous activities until the effects of CYSTAGON \u00ae on mental performance are known. Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving cysteamine bitartrate. Physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding and should inform patients and/or guardians about the signs and symptoms of serious G.I. toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. Post-marketing reports include one report of interstitial nephritis with early renal failure. A causal relationship between this event and cysteamine bitartrate therapy has not been established."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Gastrointestinal tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain have been associated with cysteamine, sometimes severe. In addition, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients on cysteamine therapy. If these develop, therapy may have to be interrupted and the dose adjusted. A cysteamine dose of 1.95 grams/m 2 /day (approximately 80 to 90 mg/kg/day) was associated with an increased number of withdrawals from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events. Cysteamine has occasionally been associated with reversible leukopenia and abnormal liver function studies. Therefore, blood counts and liver function studies should be monitored. There have been reports of benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema associated with CYSTAGON \u00ae treatment that has resolved with the addition of diuretic therapy. PTC may be more common in cystinotic patients because of concurrent medication and renal transplantation. Although a causal relationship of PTC to CYSTAGON \u00ae has not been established, physicians should monitor patients receiving CYSTAGON \u00ae for this condition. Physicians should instruct patients to report any of the following symptoms: headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurry vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. A periodic eye examination is needed to identify this condition early and timely treatment should be provided when it occurs to prevent vision loss. There have been reports of serious skin lesions in patients treated with high doses of CYSTAGON \u00ae or other cysteamine salts that have responded to cysteamine dose reduction. These skin lesions are purplish hemorrhagic lesions over the elbow area on both arms and have been described as molluscoid pseudotumors. Skin striae, bone lesions (that have been described as osteopenia, compression fractures, scoliosis and genu valgum) along with leg pain and joint hyperextension may also be present. One patient with serious skin lesions subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. Physicians should routinely monitor the skin and bones of patients receiving CYSTAGON \u00ae . If similar skin or bone abnormalities appear, the dose of CYSTAGON \u00ae should be reduced. Information for Patients and Parents and/or Guardians See attached information for patients and parents and/or guardians. Laboratory Tests Leukocyte cystine measurements are useful to determine adequate dosage and compliance. When measured 5 to 6 hours after CYSTAGON \u00ae administration, the goal should be a level < 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. In some patients with poorer tolerability for CYSTAGON \u00ae , patients may still receive benefit with a white cell cystine level of less than 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. Measurements should be done every three months, more frequently when patients are transferred from cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine solutions to CYSTAGON \u00ae . Physicians should follow patients for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, and should inform patients and/or guardians of the importance of this follow-up. Drug Interactions None have been described. CYSTAGON \u00ae can be administered with electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of the Fanconi Syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Cysteamine has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential in long-term animal studies. Cysteamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test. It produced a negative response in an in-vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in human lymphocytes, but a positive response in a similar assay in hamster ovarian cells. Repeat breeding reproduction studies were conducted in male and female rats. Cysteamine was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance at an oral dose of 75 mg/kg/day (450 mg/m 2 /day, 0.4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). At an oral dose of 375 mg/kg/day (2,250 mg/m 2 /day, 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), it reduced the fertility of the adult rats and the survival of their offspring. Pregnancy Teratology studies have been performed in rats at oral doses in a range of 37.5 to 150 mg/kg/day (about 0.2 to 0.7 times the recommended human maintenance dose on a body surface basis) and have revealed cysteamine bitartrate to be teratogenic and fetotoxic. Observed teratogenic findings were cleft palate, Kyphosis, heart ventricular septal defects, microcephaly and exencephaly. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. CYSTAGON \u00ae should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether cysteamine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the manifested potential of cysteamine for developmental toxicity in suckling rat pups when it was administered to their lactating mothers at an oral dose of 375 mg/kg/day (2,250 mg/m 2 /day, 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CYSTAGON \u00ae for cystinotic children have been established. Cysteamine therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis has been confirmed."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In three clinical trials, cysteamine or phosphocysteamine have been administered to 246 children with cystinosis. Causality of side effects is sometimes difficult to determine because adverse effects may result from the underlying disease. The most frequent adverse reactions seen involve the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. These are especially prominent at the initiation of cysteamine therapy. Temporarily suspending treatment, then gradual re-introduction may be effective in improving tolerance. Adverse reactions were not collected systematically in the NCCS, but were often listed by investigators. The following rates may therefore be underestimated. The most common events (> 5%) were vomiting 35%, anorexia 31%, fever 22%, diarrhea 16%, lethargy 11%, and rash 7%. Less common adverse events are: Body as a whole: Dehydration. Cardiovascular: Hypertension. Digestive: Nausea, bad breath, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, gastroenteritis, duodenitis, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Central Nervous System: Somnolence, encephalopathy, headache, seizures, ataxia, confusion, tremor, hyperkinesia, decreasing hearing, dizziness, jitteriness. Psychiatric: Nervousness, abnormal thinking, depression, emotional lability, hallucinations, nightmares. Integumentary: Urticaria. Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, renal failure (see WARNINGS ). Clinical Laboratory: Abnormal liver function, anemia, leukopenia. Adverse reactions or intolerance leading to cessation of treatment occurred in 8% of patients in the U.S. Studies. Withdrawals due to intolerance, vomiting associated with medication, anorexia, lethargy, and fever appeared dose related, occurring more frequently in those patients receiving 1.95 grams/m 2 /day as compared to 1.30 grams/m 2 /day.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For the management of nephropathic cystinosis, cysteamine therapy should be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed (i.e., increased white cell cystine). New patients should be started on \u00bc to 1/6 of the maintenance dose of CYSTAGON \u00ae . The dose should then be raised gradually over four to six weeks to avoid intolerance. The recommended CYSTAGON \u00ae maintenance dose for children up to age 12 years is 1.30 grams/m 2 /day of the free base, given in four divided doses. Intact CYSTAGON \u00ae capsules should not be administered to children under the age of approximately six years due to the risk of aspiration. CYSTAGON \u00ae capsules may be administered to children under the age of approximately six years by sprinkling the capsule contents over food. Patients over age 12 and over 110 pounds weight should receive 2.0 grams/day, divided four times daily. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is within two hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not double dose. When CYSTAGON \u00ae is well tolerated, the goal of therapy is to keep leukocyte cystine levels below 1 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein five to six hours following administration of CYSTAGON \u00ae . Patients with poorer tolerability still receive significant benefit if white cell cystine levels are below 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg protein. The CYSTAGON \u00ae dose can be increased to a maximum of 1.95 grams/m 2 /day to achieve this level. The dose of 1.95 grams/m 2 /day has been associated with an increased rate of withdrawal from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events. Cystinotic patients taking cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine solutions may be transferred to equimolar doses of CYSTAGON \u00ae capsules. The recommended maintenance dose of 1.30 grams/m 2 /day can be approximated by administering CYSTAGON \u00ae according to the following table, which takes surface area as well as weight into consideration.

This dose should be reached after 4 to 6 weeks of incremental dosage increases as stated above. The dose should be raised if the leukocyte cystine level remains > 2 nmol/\u00bd cystine/mg/protein. Leukocyte cystine measurements, taken 5 to 6 hours after dose administration, are recommended for new patients after the maintenance dose is achieved. Patients being transferred from cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine solutions to capsules should have their white cell cystine levels measured in 2 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months to assess optimal dosage as described above. If CYSTAGON \u00ae is poorly tolerated initially due to gastrointestinal tract symptoms or transient skin rashes, therapy should be temporarily stopped, then re-instituted at a lower dose and gradually increased to the proper dose."

      "Patient and Parent Information About CYSTAGON \u00ae (SIS-ta-gon) (cysteamine bitartrate) Capsules Read the Patient Information that comes with CYSTAGON \u00ae before you or your child starts taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your or your child\u2019s medical condition or treatment. What is CYSTAGON \u00ae ? CYSTAGON \u00ae is a medicine used to manage a medical condition called nephropathic cystinosis, in children and adults. Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare inherited condition which causes the build up of a protein building block called cystine in the kidneys. The build up of cystine causes kidney problems. These kidney problems cause the body to lose too much sugar (glucose), proteins, and electrolytes. Cystinosis may lead to slow body growth, weak bones and worsening kidney failure. Who should not take CYSTAGON \u00ae ? Do not take CYSTAGON \u00ae if you or your child is allergic to any of the ingredients in it, other products containing cysteamine, or penicillamine. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in CYSTAGON \u00ae . What should I tell my or my child\u2019s doctor before taking CYSTAGON \u00ae ? Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you or your child: \u2022 have had an allergic reaction to a medicine containing cysteamine in the past. \u2022 have a skin rash or any bone problems. \u2022 have a history of seizures, exhaustion, depression or other nervous system problems. \u2022 have or have had stomach or intestinal problems including ulcers or bleeding. \u2022 have liver or blood problems. \u2022 are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether CYSTAGON \u00ae may harm your unborn baby. Do not take CYSTAGON \u00ae during pregnancy unless you and your doctor decide that the possible benefit of taking CYSTAGON \u00ae is more important than the risk to an unborn baby. \u2022 It is not known if CYSTAGON \u00ae will pass into breast milk. You and your doctor should decide whether to stop nursing or to stop taking the medicine. Tell your doctor about all of the medicines that you or your child takes , including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you or your child takes. Keep a list of your or your child\u2019s medicines and show it to your or your child\u2019s doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should CYSTAGON \u00ae be taken ? \u2022 Take CYSTAGON \u00ae exactly as prescribed. Do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine without your doctor\u2019s approval. \u2022 If you or your child misses a dose of medicine, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is within two hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not double dose. \u2022 If you or your child takes too much CYSTAGON \u00ae , call your doctor or Poison Control Center, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. \u2022 Do not give CYSTAGON \u00ae capsules to children under six years of age. They may not be able to swallow them and may choke. For children under six years of age, the capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food. Talk to your doctor for complete directions. \u2022 Your doctor will arrange for regular blood tests to be done to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells. This will help to determine the correct dose of CYSTAGON \u00ae . Regular blood and urine tests will also be done to measure the levels of the body\u2019s important electrolytes. This will help your doctor to correctly adjust the doses of these supplements. \u2022 Your doctor may also want to do certain tests to find out if unwanted effects are occurring. The tests are very important because serious side effects, including ulcers or bleeding in the stomach and intestines (digestive tract), can occur. What should I or my child avoid while taking CYSTAGON \u00ae ? CYSTAGON \u00ae may cause some people to become sleepy or less alert than they are normally. You or your child should not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how CYSTAGON \u00ae affects you. What are the possible side effects of CYSTAGON\u00ae? CYSTAGON\u00ae can cause serious side effects, including: 1. Skin rash. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child gets a skin rash.
